{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A great look at what's new on the kosher scene - recipes, cookbook reviews, lifestyle and more!", "text": "\"Joy of Kosher\" magazine fills a much-needed niche for kosher recipes, cookbook reviews, and the kosher lifestyle not found in other mainstream magazines. Sporting beautifully-photographed covers and spreads that are equally at home next to powerhouse food and cooking magazines, \"Joy of Kosher\" (which merged with Bitayavon in 2012) is your source for all things kosher. Far beyond mere recipes, \"Joy of Kosher\" includes news on kosher restaurants, kosher wines, cookbooks, kitchen tools, holiday decorating tips, and articles on kosher travel. You'll read interviews with kosher chefs and entrepreneurs and spotlights on new kosher products. Kosher wines and wine pairings are given plenty of space; there are dozens of up-and-coming kosher wineries in Israel (over 70!) and many top-rated wines among them.<br /><br />More than just a cooking magazine (which it does very well), \"Joy of Kosher\" is a lifestyle magazine; sure, the emphasis is on kosher food and wine, but you'll also find articles on food and health, family outings/activities (such as the \"Apple Picking: the Ultimate Family Trip\" story from Fall 2013), and traditions. You'll also find articles that explore Jewish beliefs and their relationship to food. And the kosher recipes represent the culinary wealth of the Jewish Diaspora and beyond; you'll find  Italian caponata and herbed spaetzle rubbing elbows with whitefish shu mai dumplings, beef larb, or Moroccan-inspired tagines, along with upscale kosher dishes that mirror current trends. You'll see many articles and recipes from famous chefs in the kosher food world, including Jamie Geller (the \"Jewish Rachael Ray\" and author of two kosher cookbooks, including [[ASIN:0062207822 Joy of Kosher: Fast, Fresh Family Recipes]]), kosher pastry chef Paula Shoyer (author of [[ASIN:1454907142 The Holiday Kosher Baker: Traditional & Contemporary Holiday Desserts]]), and Chef Laura Frankel (author of my favorite \"[[ASIN:0470260890 Jewish Slow Cooker Recipes]]\").<br /><br />Most importantly, the recipes are completely approachable using ingredients that should be readily available at your supermarket. Each issue also includes a handy recipe and nutrition guide that features an alphabetical listing of all recipes along with calories, fiber, sodium, carbs, fat and protein; as I watch my fat and calorie intake, I appreciated having this information readily available as not many cooking magazines provide it on a consistent basis (if at all). Recent issues have also put a spotlight on gluten-free and other special diets and a special focus on seasonal foods.<br /><br />One thing you'll quickly notice is that advertising takes up a fair chunk of the magazine; in the Winter 2013 issue, I counted about 25 pages of full and half-page ads (some for other Joy of Kosher products) out of about 83 total. The colorful advertising in many cases blends in fairly seamlessly with the rest of the content.<br /><br />The Joy of Kosher website offers additional articles, recipes, (kosher) cookbook reviews and giveaways that have introduced me to some great new kosher cookbooks (and I was also lucky enough to win an [[ASIN:B0015FLBCA Emile Henry Flame Top 3.7 Quart Tagine, Red]] as part of their \"Best of Kosher 2013\" contest!). Whether you're looking for new ideas for quick and easy (or international-themed) kosher meals, decorating ideas, or kosher vacation rentals and getaways, you're sure to love \"Joy of Kosher\"!", "images": [], "asin": "B00HCR5090", "parent_asin": "B00HCR5090", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1396827173000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "If you enjoy reading an eye-catching, easy-to-follow cooking magazine with fresh updates on old favorites, this is for you.", "text": "I've been addicted to Martha Stewart's Everyday Food for several years, but until recently, I had been buying it by the issue instead of shelling out $30 for a year's subscription.<br /><br />I love the fact that Everyday Food takes everyday ingredients and makes them extraordinary. Example: in a recent issue, 10 different chicken recipes were given, along with a primer on chicken and a wine pairing guide. The included chicken recipes ranged from classics such as chicken tenders, BBQ chicken and chicken club salad to the more exotic Greek chicken cutlets (with feta, olives, tomato and mint) and Indian-spiced braised chicken (ginger, coriander, yogurt, garam masala).<br /><br />Another issue had a divine no-hassle dessert that tasted like a labor-intensive tiramisu: whipped ricotta, sugar, and instant espresso topped with crumbled cookies. Bonus: no raw eggs.<br /><br />Everyday Food also has an eye out for healthier foods, including a focus on whole grains. Another recent issue featured a delicious bulgur breakfast porridge and veggie burgers with tahini mayonnaise. In the back of each issue is an Everyday Pantry checklist perfect for ripping out and taking along to the store. There is also a nutritional guide provided (I liked it better when it was at the rear of each magazine rather than in the front next to the table of contents).<br /><br />In addition, Everyday Food frequently features articles on kitchen tools and appliances that are helpful for novice and experienced cooks alike.<br /><br />My main criticism is that for a slim magazine, roughly 40% consists of distracting print ads. Also, Everyday Food is on the expensive side at $35 for 10 issues. And I liked it better having the nutritional info listed at the back, rather than the front. But these are minor gripes.<br /><br />Compact and colorful, Everyday Food is a wonderful tool for any chef, particularly if you're short on time and you're looking for new ways to spice up your weeknight menus.", "images": [], "asin": "B0000ARXXS", "parent_asin": "B0000ARXXS", "user_id": "AFW2PDT3AMT4X3PYQG7FJZH5FXFA", "timestamp": 1181880255000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}

From time to time I've thought about letting my subscription lapse (to save a little money and some storage space), but then I remember that PIECEWORK is the one magazine that I always look at and read, as soon as each new issue arrives.<br /><br />When PIECEWORK was first launched, it had more emphasis on historical textiles (many of museum quality) than it does at present.  Today, because the magazine has already published so many articles on historical textiles, the emphasis is more on using historical textiles as inspiration for modern projects.  But each issue still includes complete instructions for a few small projects that use the historical/ethnic designs or techniques described in the articles (e.g., a crocheted lace edging, an embroidered sampler, a knitted Peruvian hat, a small pieced quilt).<br /><br />In recent years, PIECEWORK has published annual \"lace\" and \"historical knitting\" issues, which have multiple articles dealing with those special topics.  I love the special issues, but I also enjoy the regular issues that include a variety of short articles on several different kinds of handwork--ranging from sewn aprons through beaded bags, the Bayeux Tapestry, embroidered pincushions, a silk wedding dress made from a WWII parachute, Coptic socks, nursery rhyme buttons, decorative braided landscapes, linens embellished with hardanger embroidery, or some other kind of handmade item, depending on the issue.  The short articles are illustrated with historical photos, and often accompanied by references for further reading.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "New Mexico Travel and Culture", "text": "I like magazines that emphasize travel and culture. I like them even more when they focus not just on the popular tourist spots, but also on lesser- known travel gems that can be found in every state in the nation. A magazine that fulfills my wishes is New Mexico Magazine.<br /><br />With this monthly publication, you get a rundown of the events, the places, the people, the art, and the food that make New Mexico unique. The photography is eye- catching and there is a good mixture of articles relating to natural attractions vs man- made points of interest and events, as well as a good number of articles dedicated to well-known and not well- known attractions.<br /><br />The layout of this publication is good and I like the state map in the front that shows the locations of the featured destinations in each issue. There are monthly sections for art and food, the latter of which includes recipes so that you can create authentic New Mexican food right at home. For a touch of humor, turn near the end of the issue and enjoy the monthly feature called One of Our 50 is Missing. It has short, funny stories of New Mexicans who discover that much of the rest of United States is apparently unaware that New Mexico is a U.S. state.<br /><br />It's fun to learn about places to go and people to meet. New Mexico has much to offer in terms of natural scenery, great food and culture, and friendly folks. New Mexico Magazine brings it all together for you, in each monthly issue.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Get Your Dose of Political Discussion with The Nation", "text": "Politics can make for some entertaining and lively conversation. In recent years in particular, political talk has been livelier than ever, but it has also turned ugly and the once civil discourse between dissenting views has become more opinionated and even personal. One magazine that fits in very well with these times of political polarization is The Nation<br /><br />The Nation is a magazine that is all about political issues from a decidedly left- leaning perspective. No matter what the issue, The Nation takes a progressive position that seeks to bring about change in order to benefit the largest number of people - at least, in the minds of its writers. Whether the topic is gun control, taxing the wealthy, improving health care, or expanding government benefits, The Nation\u2019s position is frank and always takes a leftward slant.<br /><br />I read a few different political magazines and have found some of them good, even if I don\u2019t necessarily agree with every position they take.  With The Nation, the formula is similar to that of other political magazines but one difference I have noticed is that The Nation seems a little more extreme and angrier than the others of its ilk. The articles sometimes voice a sense of irritation, like the writers just cannot believe what is going on around them and why Americans have not wised up and smelled the dead rat in front of them. Yes, there are some articles like this in the other political publications, but the Nation really lets its irritation shine through.<br /><br />This is not to say that The Nation is completely without any good articles. It does hit the nail on the head with several of them, like ones promoting church/state separation, civil rights, and other topics. The writers do manage to make some very compelling, articulate points. The articles that voice irritation can sometimes twist reasoning and logic, but these social issue articles often make good sense and the writers seem to know the topics well. Yes, they are biased but that is precisely what a magazine like this is all about: Promoting a specific point of view from one side of the issue, completing ignoring most or all counter viewpoints.<br /><br />I like reading political magazines even if I don\u2019t agree with everything they say. The Nation has some articles that are difficult to stomach, but it has others that offer some good insights into the important issues of the day from an alternative but always left- leaning perspective. Even if you are a dyed in the wool conservative, there are still some important things to learn from the opposition and The Nation provides everything you would ever want to know about education, the economy, foreign policy, civil rights and more from a distinctly leftward point of view.", "images": [], "asin": "B00XZF1JUM", "parent_asin": "B00XZF1JUM", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1561600676336, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "America's National Parks Need Our Protection", "text": "America has many great wonderlands and its system of National Parks, National Preserves, Seashores, Monuments, Memorials, etc., is the most developed in the world. The many great scenic and historical preservations are spotlighted in this publication, National Parks Magazine, the magazine of the National Parks Conservation Association.<br /><br />National Parks Magazine is published quarterly and can be counted on for about three featured articles and standard departments. The magazine aims to keep its supporters and others informed about the challenges, success stories, and various concerns surrounding the different units of the National Park service.<br /><br />This magazine is published by a non- profit organization that is focused on conservation and because of that fact, the issues tend to talk mainly about the many problems that plague the parks and what needs to be done to correct them. The NPCA likes to talk about its own efforts and successes in this magazine, but it is also quick to point out when more work needs to be done.  Other readings in each issue sometimes venture into informative or educational articles. The informative articles are the type one would expect in a publication such as this. They feature a specific National Park, National River, etc., and then take the reader on a journey throughout the park unit, filling the reader in on the important things to know if planning a visit. The educational articles are often about animals and present facts that make the animal unique and worth conserving.<br /><br />National Parks Magazine is a very nice, well- written and informative read and there are very few advertisements. America has some amazing National Parks, National Monuments, and other nationally designated sites and National Parks Magazine does a nice job bringing the different units into your life through its quarterly reporting. It would be cool if the magazine talked more about visiting the parks and what they offer, but you have to keep in mind that this magazine is tied to a non- profit organization that is focused on conservation and because of this, the writings ten to be geared in an activist direction. Remember this before you decide to subscribe and enjoy your issues of National Parks Magazine.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006KP86", "parent_asin": "B00006KP86", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1560303617546, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Learn About Our Past with American Archaeology", "text": "Published by the Archaeological Conservancy, American Archaeology is a quarterly publication that summarizes many of the important happenings in the world of archaeology around the United States. The magazine talks about ancient cultures and ways of life as we interpret them today based on recent archaeological findings.<br /><br />I\u2019m a supporter of the Archaeological Conservancy and one of the benefits of supporting this non- profit organization is that you get a subscription to this magazine with your membership. And it is certainly worth the money, as this is easily one of the best magazines of its kind or any kind. The articles help you get in touch with ancient peoples, understand their way of life, and discover what drove Native Americans and others to live the way they lived.<br /><br />This publication isn\u2019t strictly about the United States. It does venture into other areas of the continent from time to time and it doesn\u2019t always resort to ancient times for its inspiration. Some of the articles are based on happenings from the more recent past- sometimes, only a hundred or so years ago. It shows that any piece of history, ancient or not, can still be worthy of an archaeological discovery.<br /><br />American Archaeology is a well- edited magazine and one thing many readers will greatly appreciate is the lack of advertising. Other than a few small ads near the beginning and end of each issue, the rest of the magazine is advertisement free. And even the few ads that exist are not bad at all, for the simple fact that they feature relevant services, usually seminars and excursions focused on archaeology.<br /><br />Learning about the past and preserving historic sites, structures, burial mounds, etc. is an important way to discover more about who we are as people. American Archaeology is an excellent publication for those who want to tap into our heritage and learn more ways how we can preserve and interpret these important remnants of human history. It\u2019s one of my favorite magazines and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in this subject.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/613ysz4j6EL._SL1600_.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B00006K32H", "parent_asin": "B00006K32H", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1538967465998, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Archaeology Magazine: One of the Best Magazines in Existence", "text": "I have several magazines that I consult for my reading enjoyment and/or enlightenment. With most of them, I thumb through and focus only on articles that seem interesting, but there are a few magazines that seem to hit the mark so consistently that I read the almost the entire issue month after month. One good example of the latter is Archaeology Magazine.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from most others is the content itself. Yes, there are some cool illustrations but where Archaeology Magazine shines is with the articles themselves. They are packed full of fascinating information and they enrich your knowledge of history. And I don\u2019t mean refresh your knowledge- I mean enrich, because much of what you read here is going to involve historical facts you likely never heard before. I come away from every issue learning something brand new about a specific era in world history and the cultures that lived and thrived during that time.<br /><br />Archaeology Magazine has very few advertisements. Most of them are clustered at the end of each issue, so you get uninterrupted reading from start to finish. Another thing I love is that most of the articles are not excessively long. Some are only a half- page or less. At most, they might cover four pages tops. I like this, because I\u2019m the type who may not want to commit to a long, say, 10 page magazine article. I read some magazine with long articles like this and the moment I see that it\u2019s going to be this long- and I always check before I start reading- I often skip the article completely.<br /><br />Yet another reason to love Archaeology Magazine is the quality of the writing. The editors make sure each article is clear and concise, with proper grammar and clarity. The articles are educational and they maintain an academic style. You\u2019re not going to find much in the way of humor or other creative forms of non- fiction prose. No, Archaeology Magazine sticks with the facts and presents them in and informative way that archaeology and history enthusiasts will appreciate.<br /><br />I usually skim through most magazines, but Archaeology Magazine is different. It is one of the very few magazines that maintain my interest from beginning to end, with every article worthy of a read. Try this magazine for yourself, and get enlightened on the fascinating world we live in and all of its glorious past.", "images": [{"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Jl7G5XcXL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}, {"small_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL._SL256_.jpg", "medium_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL._SL800_.jpg", "large_image_url": "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81Y8aFaIzSL.jpg", "attachment_type": "IMAGE"}], "asin": "B000FTJ7BE", "parent_asin": "B000FTJ7BE", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1526830776794, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "National Wildlife Magazine Informs and Educates", "text": "National Wildlife Magazine is a very nice publication for those with an active interest in wildlife protection and general nature conservation. It offers some very good articles on wildlife and the constant struggles animals face as they fight for survival in a world increasingly dominated by humans.<br /><br />National Wildlife Magazine seeks to inform and educate and its articles include stories about success stories and challenges as well as the occasional article or department that offers up animal trivia and facts. One article may include a story about the loss of habitat for wild cats while another may talk about the brute size and strength of a rhinoceros. Whatever the story, this magazine is right there, informing and educating its readers about the wild and wonderful world of animals.<br /><br />Advertisements are part of this publication and this fact may surprise some who read this publication for the first time. Many non- profit organizations publish magazines but a good percentage of these magazines are completely ad- free. This magazine has a few ads, but they cover only about one- fifth of the pages in each issue. There are few enough of them that they do not take away from the magazine's enjoyment.<br /><br />Besides the articles, another excellent feature of National Wildlife Magazine is the photography. In fact, I would bet that some people try to get their hands on this magazine solely for the purpose of looking at those amazing photographs of animals in their natural habitat. The photographs are impressive and memorable, with some of them depicting an animal standing still or lying down in the wild and others showing an animal chasing and catching its prey, in high speed detail. Every issue is loaded with these amazing pictures of animals and it isn't surprising that so many readers mention the photographs among their favorite parts of the magazine.<br /><br />Wildlife continues to struggle for survival and National Wildlife Magazine is one of the better non- profit publications that bring this information to your home. It is not an easy magazine to find, but I recommend grabbing and reading a copy if you can. It rates among my all- time favorite wildlife magazines.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006KPBF", "parent_asin": "B00006KPBF", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1348858351000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Garden Gate: Great Magazine Free From Advertising", "text": "Garden Gate Magazine is a publication for gardeners of all stripes- a magazine with nice photography, gardening and craft instructions, and general tips to make your garden and general landscaping look better then ever. Amatuers and experienced gardeners alike will find many useful tips and bits of advice on decoration, plant care, and more.<br /><br />I'm not big on outdoor creations, but I agree that a well- manicured landscape and a nice garden area is not only easy on the eyes, it can also add a sense of peacefulness by its mere presence. Who doesn't enjoy walking into a beautiful garden area? Even if you have little interest in gardening, horticulture, or anything related, there is much to be said for a nice, green/flowery yard and Garden Gate Magazine is very useful to help you achieve exactly that, with projects and advice for individuals at different skill levels.<br /><br />I have been reading Garden Gate Magazine for only a short time but I have found much useful information in this publication. The lists and the step by step instructions are among my favorites and I like that the magazine is not geared only toward those with the extra- green thumbs. I am not very skilled in a garden so I need a publication that respects my limited abilities. Garden Gate Magazine has plenty to offer an inexperienced person like myself and at the same time, it has plenty of great ideas that involve more extensive building and planting, making the magazine useful for the more experienced individual. Garden Gate Magazine leaves no person behind, and that is one of the publication's many appeals.<br /><br />Garden Gate Magazine spells everything out nicely and includes plenty of diagrams so that even an outdoor klutz like myself can figure out what each thing means and what to do. The magazine has a good deal of information, too, and some might find it surprising that a publication with only 50 pages can include so much in so little space. Take a look at the Departments, \"In Every Issue\", and features listed above. When was the last time you saw a table of contents like that in a fifty-page magazine? There is a reason Garden Gate Magazine is able to pack in so much in so little room and the reason is there are no advertisements!! This is such a refreshing change from other magazines and it makes a big difference when you are trying to follow instructions. There is nothing to distract and the articles are not very long, making this the perfect reading option for those with shorter attention spans.<br /><br />When a magazine is free from advertisements, it is often high in price and Garden Gate Magazine is no exception. The magazine is published only six times per year and each issue carries a high cover price around five dollars. To make matters worse, you don't get much of a cut in price when you subscribe. Buy all six issues at your local newsstand and it will cost you $30. Subscribe for a year, and it will cost you $24. This is a savings, yes, but it isn't nearly the level of subscription savings so common with other magazines. A two- year deal makes the savings better (presently 2 years are offered for $38, cutting the cover price by 37 percent), but the cost per issue is still quite high and it is the direct result of publishing ad- free.<br /><br />If you can get past the cost, however, you will find that Garden Gate Magazine is a very good magazine with much to offer everyone who loves a nice landscape. As I said, I'm not even much into this type of work and I don't landscape as a hobby, yet I still like reading this magazine. If a publication can pique the interest of someone who doesn't even have a true interest in the subject, it must be doing something right and Garden Gate Magazine is definitely a periodical that is doing almost everything correctly.", "images": [], "asin": "B002MRSM8Q", "parent_asin": "B002MRSM8Q", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1342813850000, "helpful_vote": 25, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "National Geographic Kids: Too Much Fluff, too Little Education", "text": "Kids like to read magazines and books as long as they contain visual elements, games, and other things to keep them entertained. They don't even mind a little bit of education and learning as long as it is entertaining in some way. This is why kids' magazines are often so visual and colorful and National Geographic kids is, as expected, a publication loaded with pictures and bright colors. The magazine is focused mainly on animals, but also includes material on science, geography, technology, etc.<br /><br />My girls are big fans of several kids' magazines and they look forward to receiving issues in the mail each month. I like most of them, due to their educational value. But I must take exception to National Geographic Kids magazine. This publication does contain some educational material, but the problem is that the education is minimal, with the remaining pages covered with meaningless fluff and advertisements. The ads are especially annoying because National Geographic Kids intermingles the ads into what seems like an educational article. It is done in a subtle way that you may not even notice at first.<br /><br />National Geographic Kids attempts to break up the educational material with trivia, some photographs, and a few other things, but they are not items I would expect to see in a publication that is supposed to be aimed at children in the later elementary school age years and that is supposed to educate. It is also surprising how thin the magazine is- it seems more like a thick newsletter than a magazine publication.<br /><br />National Geographic itself is a great magazine and I am very surprised that such a quality publication would permit its name to be scarred by the likes of this magazine. It could be so much better with a little work. It isn't like National Geographic doesn't have the resources to make improvements. They have the expertise and the know- how to make a quality kids magazine, but seem content with this publication in its present form, in spite of its many flaws.<br /><br />Kids magazines are plentiful and there are some really good publications available that help teach kids about different subjects in an entertaining way. National Geographic Kids, unfortunately, isn't one of them. The worthwhile material can be isolated to about one- third of the magazine's limited pages and the overall educational value is minimal. Sum everything together and you have a magazine that isn't worth the money and should be avoided.", "images": [], "asin": "B000063XJL", "parent_asin": "B000063XJL", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1336315735000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Texas Monthly Keeps You Up to Speed with the Lone Star State", "text": "Texas Monthly Magazine is a magazine about a state, its places, and its people. This publication covers Texas culture, travel, music, arts, dining, special events, and more. Each issue takes readers on a journey throughout the state and keeps them up to date on the Lone Star State and her people.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine has more departments than the typical magazine and many of them are fun to read, offering a quick look inside a lesser- known town, festival, or individual that calls Texas home. A good example is the department titled Street Smarts. This short section offers a glimpse inside one of Texas' thousands of small towns along with a numbered list of special points of interest in the city. The music and books departments are fun, too, because they present some popular and soon- to- be- popular media from Texas residents. Another department I like for its pleasant amusement is one called the Manual. It presents something Texas- related in the areas of fashion and style and then offers some advice on the best usage or display of the item based on Texas culture.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine offers several long, featured articles and they can usually be found starting in the middle of each issue and continuing all the way to about the three- quarter mark. These longer featured articles can focus on most anything, from travel to art to food, to the people who create the art and prepare the food.  There are usually at least a few current event- type articles related to something important in the news while the other featured articles include stories about people, events, etc., that are generally timeless.<br /><br />Texas Monthly Magazine is a well- written, well- edited magazine and it a nice reference and reading tool for Texas residents who like to learn more about the state and find new places to visit and things to try. I like having it handy, but if I could change one thing about this magazine, it would be the number of ads in each issue. True, all magazines need advertisements in order to generate reveune, but the number of ads in Texas Monthly Magazine is a tad excessive. Each issue opens up with about eighteen pages of ads before even reaching the table of contents. The next hundred or so pages have ads on every other page and the ads only diminish when you get to one of the featured articles. After that, the ads return for the remainder of the issue, with the final thirty to fifty pages consisting of practically nothing but ads.<br /><br />Going back to the positive points, another reason to like Texas Monthly is the long length of each issue. The magazine is much longer than most, with some issues approaching 300 pages in length. Yes, the ads are excessive, but even if all the ads were removed, you would still have a very large amount of reading material in each issue- much more than found in the majority of magazines.<br /><br />Texas is a very large, very diverse state with many things to offer and Texas Monthly is a very enjoyable read that helps Texas residents keep up with some of the many happenings in this great state. The ads are excessive, but when all factors are taken into account, this is still an enjoyable publication that every Texan should read and that many outsiders will enjoy as well.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7T3", "parent_asin": "B00005N7T3", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1324699161000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Women's Fitness, and Other Things", "text": "Fitness Magazine is a health/beauty/fitness publication that concentrates its efforts on the physical well- being of the individual. This magazine is geared toward woman's health and it offers some good articles on such health- inspired topics as the nutritional content of specific foods; strategies for losing weight; natural ways to battle allergies; and many more.<br /><br />Getting in shape and staying in shape are certainly worthwhile goals and this magazine has some good pointers, but there are a few things about this magazine that I do not appreciate. One is the misleading title. When I see the word \"fitness\" on the front of a magazine, I expect the publication to dedicate itself not just to losing weight, but also staying in shape through physical workouts, weightlifting, and more. However, there isn't much in this magazine that is dedicated to fitness education, weightlifting, or any other similar topic. The other issue I have with this magazine is its beauty and fashion emphasis. True, some of these articles do correlate with health and fitness but others are more fluff than substance.<br /><br />Looking at other aspects of Fitness Magazine, I like that it includes the featured cover articles in their own reference section because this makes it easy to open an issue and go directly to an article of interest. I also like the low price. You don't find magazines priced at such a low level nowadays, and this is a refreshing change. On the other hand, there are a large number of advertisements in each issue, and this is likely part of the reason the retail price is kept at such a low level.<br /><br />So, what is my bottom line on this magazine? Well, there is some good material in this publication, some good advice on medical matters and nutrition, and other positive qualities. However, this publication deviates from the subject of fitness on a frequent basis and it doesn't contain many articles on the mind and spirit, like its subtitle suggests. Thus, the pros and cons are just about on par with each other, leading to an average rating overall.", "images": [], "asin": "B0029XHGT4", "parent_asin": "B0029XHGT4", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1291846065000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Popular Mechanics: Practical and often Fascinating", "text": "Popular Mechanics is a magazine dedicated to mechanics, repair, industry, and technology. This magazine offers timely articles that are often intelligent, thought- provoking, and often fascinating and/or awe- inspiring. They often talk about mechanical achievements, impressive technology, record- setting feats, etc. These articles show what humans are capable of doing and they remain in your memory for some time.<br /><br />These achievement- type articles are often the best in each issue, however, Popular Mechanics is more than just a magazine about incredible achievements. With Popular Mechanics, you get articles about cars, home improvement, repair, etc., which are more practical than anything. Car enthusiasts often enjoy Popular Mechanics more than anyone, due to the magazine's consistent articles on automobiles and reviews of automobiles. There are, in fact, multiple articles on automobiles and/or automotive technology in each issue and they are often among the lengthiest in the magazine.<br /><br />Besides cars, Popular Mechanics likes to devote space to the subject of home repair and improvement. These articles are nice because they offer practical advice that can help do- it- yourself readers save a good deal of cash. They are often educational in nature, too. How Your House Works, for example, is a subsection of the Home department and it describes in detail how a certain part of your home functions. It might sound boring at first, but it is often fascinating to learn what goes on behind the walls, under the foundation, inside the appliances, etc. Sometimes, the educational lesson is obvious but other times, the lessons learned are eye- opening and will expose homeowners to things about their home they never knew existed.<br /><br />Popular Mechanics is, overall, a very nice publication that I will continue to read. I like the articles that emphasize fascinating innovation and achievement best, but I can also agree that the home and automotive articles are very practical and useful. The over- emphasis on automobiles is a small complaint about Popular Mechanics, but the magazine as a whole is very good and very readable.", "images": [], "asin": "B001THPA26", "parent_asin": "B001THPA26", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1282924980000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Garden and Gun: The Allure of Southern Culture", "text": "Garden and Gun is a magazine about Southern living, with a combination of articles that appeal to both women and men. This magazine covers a range of topics that can include everything from gardening to history to hunting and beyond.<br /><br />Garden and Gun is a magazine with an unusual title and this is the first aspect of the magazine that will catch your attention. What kind of a title is Garden and Gun? It sounds like some sort of twisted joke, but there is a reason for the unusual choice of title. It is intended to demonstrate the wide range of topics contained within and the balance between articles that appeal to men vs. articles that appeal to women, in contrast to most other southern reads which are often designed to appeal only to women. For the most part, this magazine succeeds with its balance, although there tend to be more articles related to gardens than to guns.<br /><br />Garden and Gun has a large number of departments and they include everything from cooking, to sports, to music, to fashion, and beyond. And, of course, they all relate to the American South. One department might focus on Southern eating while another will focus on Southern architecture. Each article concentrates on the southern way of doing things and how this part of the United States has its own particular means to achieve an end. The writing is good and often features comments and interviews from ordinary people who love their southern heritage and want to share it with the reader.<br /><br />Photography is important to any magazine and the photos in Garden and Gun add significantly to the magazine's appeal. The photos include a fair share of scenic places, but the appeal goes beyond that. The photos depicting ordinary things are just as interesting. The food, for example, is often photographed in a way that brings out the fine details of the featured dish and many will be impressed by how realistic it looks. You will also find interesting photographs taken in unheard of places. It could be a simple photo of a schoolhouse or a photo of an empty church. These are the types of photographs you don't expect to see in a magazine and, like a work of art, they get your imagination going.<br /><br />Garden and Gun tends to jump around with its articles, and this fact may not sit well with some readers. I find it okay, but one fact I wish was different is the magazine's tendency to play it safe and stick with topics that are non- controversial in nature. We all know that southern politics are known for their conservative bend and southerners often accept socially conservative beliefs as gospel truth. These topics of controversy would make for some great articles, but Garden and Gun tends to avoid this type of material and stick with whatever is safe. Even the articles about guns and hunting are presented in a non- confrontational way.<br /><br />Southerners have their own way of doing things and Garden and Gun does a good job capturing the soul of the American South. I like the photography most of all and there are some good departments in each issue. The publication has a few shortcomings, but it is good enough for the occasional read.", "images": [], "asin": "B000O1PKOG", "parent_asin": "B000O1PKOG", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1268773552000, "helpful_vote": 30, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Ready Made: Tacky, but Sometimes Fun and Interesting", "text": "Ready Made Magazine is a publication aimed at the young person who likes to create his/her own things, and these things could include anything from clothing, to furniture, to mixed drinks, and beyond. More than just a magazine about saving money, Ready Made is a publication that attempts to bring out the creative side in its readers with suggestions for making everyday items from ordinary goods.<br /><br />Ready Made spends most of its pages showing readers some unique ways to make things, and the suggestions range from the practical to the unusual. On the practical side, the magazine suggests making things like planters using coffee cans and vases using empty bottles. But then, there are some crafts that are not so obvious, like using a metal mixing bowl for a light fixture by inverting the bowl and attaching a light bulb from the inside. You never really know what unusual ideas Ready Made Magazine is going to offer in each issue, and this helps keep the magazine fresh and somewhat interesting.<br /><br />Judging Ready Made Magazine as a whole is sometimes difficult due to the nature of the publication. Creativity is certainly a good quality, but Ready Made Magazine gets a little too weird for my tastes. Suggestions for making your own soap, creating different foods, and making mixed drinks are fine and normal, but some of the suggested crafts are odd at best and extremely tacky at worst. Taking things like sandwich boxes, cookie tins, mail boxes, and other things and turning them into lights and other fixtures can result in some incredibly tacky d\u00e9cor. And the clothing suggestions are often too outrageous to be true. How many among us want to be seen wearing a skirt made from an old pillow case? Every now and then, Ready Made Magazine will surprise me with a recycled item that actually looks presentable but more often than not, the suggestions look a little too contemporary and non- traditional for my tastes.<br /><br />Ready Made Magazine is a publication that many will find entertaining, but usually for the wrong reasons. I like some of the articles on recipes and making household cleaners but the suggestions for do it yourself projects are often beyond the scope of good taste. You will end up either shaking your head in disbelief or enjoying a good laugh as you soak up the tackiness and wonder exactly who would really want some of these unusual items in their home or on their person. So, when all factors are considered, Ready Made adds up to an average magazine overall with an equal balance between good and bad points.", "images": [], "asin": "B000XXDJ8E", "parent_asin": "B000XXDJ8E", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1264015011000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Improve Your Woodworking Knowledge and Skill", "text": "Woodworking is a popular hobby and those who partake in this activity often turn to printed resources for new ideas, tips, etc. Wood Magazine is one publication designed to help woodworkers in several ways. It offers new techniques, new tools, and new projects for the budding or experienced woodworker who is seeking out ways to improve/develop their woodworking talents. Wood Magazine wants its readers to be educated and curious, and it offers articles that satisfy both desires.<br /><br />Wood Magazine's articles span a wide range, with some that cover basic tasks like cutting wood at an angle to more complicated tasks like carving unique shapes and patterns. One fact that readers will notice immediately is that Wood Magazine's articles are divided up so that woodworkers at all levels- from novice to expert- will find something to which they can relate. The articles tend to lean slightly toward the beginner to intermediate level, but there are certainly enough advanced articles in each issue to keep all woodworkers busy and satisfied.<br /><br />The articles in Wood Magazine are generally short, and they are often written in a step by step format, with illustrations and measurements (where applicable) to remove any guesswork from the process. These visual aspects and step/bulleted format make the magazine seem like a reference guide at times, but they are very useful for someone who wants to build one of the items and doesn't want to take any chances.<br /><br />If there is anything unattractive about Wood Magazine, it would have to be the high price. The cover price is high and there is little discount incentive when you sign up for a subscription. Also, this magazine is published only seven times per year. This latter fact could frustrate some woodworkers who want new and fresh ideas on a more frequent basis.<br /><br />Aside from the cost, however, Wood Magazine is a good magazine for woodworkers at all levels. The tips and tricks are useful, the education valuable, and the projects interesting and/or practical. It makes a good magazine for the occasional or serious woodworker who wants to develop one's skill and/or increase one's interest in the art of making things from wood. A little more length to the magazine and a lower price would be nice, but it is still a good magazine overall.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006LIR1", "parent_asin": "B00006LIR1", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1261508375000, "helpful_vote": 1, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Improve Your Knowledge, with Popular Science", "text": "Popular Science is a magazine I have been reading on and off for more than twenty years and it ranks as a science magazine for the masses. As most readers will tell you, Popular Science is a beginner's science publication and is generally intended for those who are curious about science and want to gain a better understanding of science and technology.<br /><br />Popular Science is more about technology than science and this is evident from the departments and most of the featured articles. Yes, Popular Science does include articles about atoms, chemicals, outer space, physics, etc., but the majority of the articles are about modern technology and its uses and applications. The technology articles are dedicated to subjects such as new vehicles, environmental trends, electronic devices, and more. Articles like these might seem a little out of scope, but one has to remember that the first word in the title of the magazine is Popular. Technology is huge, so it makes sense that the magazine would dedicate such a large percentage of its articles to high tech.<br /><br />The writing in Popular Science is very good, but as I said before, this magazine is intended more as a beginner's guide to science and technology. This means the articles will be perfectly fine for those with limited science and technology knowledge.  For those with a more advanced scientific mind, some of the articles may be too elementary. However, every issue can be counted on for at least a couple of in-depth, intellectual articles. Also, one needs to keep in mind that the articles are generally short and cover only a page or two. This is nice for those with shorter attention spans and for those who want to soak up as many facts about as many different things as possible.<br /><br />Learning more about science and technology is certainly a good idea and Popular Science is a good choice of reading material for those who are scientifically curious, want to improve their science knowledge level, and want to learn about the latest technology. The magazine could prove to be a little too simplistic for those with a working or educational background in science, but for everyone else, Popular Science presents a good means to keep up with the latest in science and high tech with writing that is clear and intelligent without going over the top.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7SC", "parent_asin": "B00005N7SC", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1260591102000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Dwell Magazine Offers Unique Designs for the Home", "text": "My mailbox overflows with magazines and among the themes, home and home- related topics are the most common. Dwell Magazine ranks as one of the better home magazines I read each month and it is one of only a few publications that I will return to throughout the month for entertainment and other purposes.<br /><br />What makes Dwell a unique publication is its dedication to more interesting and unusual home remodeling and rebuilding ideas. Other modern home magazines exist, but Dwell Magazine takes the idea of modern to a slightly different level than other, similar publications. With Dwell Magazine, the reader is presented with unusual homes, both on the exterior and interior, and many of them are certainly eye- catching, if nothing else. This magazine is all about homes that offer distinction and some of the design ideas are very interesting and will stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Probably the most unique fact about Dwell Magazine is that, while it focuses on unusual and creative home design, it manages to maintain a level of livability. Other magazines that focus on unusual things- whether it's the home or something else- often take the weirdness factor to the extreme and they end up alienating most readers. But Dwell Magazine avoids making this mistake. The ideas it presents are unusual and creative, but still within the boundaries of taste and practicality.<br /><br />Magazines usually offer articles that cover a large range of topics each month, but one other interesting aspect of Dwell Magazine is that each magazine is based on a specific theme. This theme is clearly spelled out on the front cover, directly under the magazine's name, in bold letters. This is nice because you already have a good idea what to expect when you open the pages of any issue. The featured articles for the month will stick to the main theme for that particular issue.<br /><br />Dwell Magazine is one of hundreds of publications that focus on the home, but it easily stands out in the pack and I rank it among my favorites in this genre. I'm not into home design on a do-it-yourself level, but I do like to look at homes and the rooms within homes and I am always open to new ideas. Dwell Magazine offers plenty of creative ideas every month and it's a good magazine to consult for home makeover plans.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIRE", "parent_asin": "B00005NIRE", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1257190191000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Enjoy a Fantasy, with Yachting Magazine", "text": "Yachting Magazine is a publication dedicated to the acquisition of large sea going vessels and the enjoyment that spending time on a yacht can bring. This publication is all about big boats, with an emphasis that is divided between buying a yacht, comparing yacht performance, evaluating new models of yachts, and enjoying life to the fullest as the owner/operator of your own home on the water.<br /><br />Yachting Magazine is a magazine about luxury and it compares favorably to other, similar publications. Magazines about yachts are intended for an elite group of people for whom money is no object and Yachting Magazine is no different. The big boats talked about, tested, and offered for sale in the classified section usually sell for a minimum price of around half a million dollars and many of them sell for multiple millions of dollars, placing the bulk of the magazine's promoted material out of the reach of most individuals.<br /><br />Even though yachting magazine is impractical for most people, there are a few nice features with Yachting Magazine and at the top of the list is the photography. Not only do you get to gaze in awe at these incredible aquatic machines, you also get to enjoy great photographs of beautiful lakes, oceans, and rivers where yachts of different sizes can often be found. These photographs set the imagination soaring and they rank as the magazine's number one asset. Second to the photographs are the travel articles. Again, they usually feature some nice photography, not to mention a few travel secrets from coastal and/or riverfront cities around the world.<br /><br />As for the writing in Yachting Magazine, it is generally good, but other than the articles mentioned above, most of the material in this publication is too simplistic and/or irrelevant to the bulk of the population. For example, the evaluations of new make/model of yachts are often very lacking, offering only a one page summary, which isn't nearly enough to make an informed buying decision. Worse from a practical standpoint, the vessels the magazine features are usually in the one million+ dollar price range. This is fantasy material for most people. The yachts are nice to look at and fantasize about, but unless I receive a pay raise in the one- thousand percent range, there is practically no chance that I will be purchasing a multi- million dollar yacht any time soon.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, Yachting Magazine is an acceptable publication that I will continue to read solely for its eye- candy properties. I really like the photography and the magazine can sometimes impress with a few of its travel articles. But other than that, Yachting Magazine is a fantasy read, pure and simple. Even though the photographs are great and they can set your imagination on fire, the magazine is an impractical read for most with more fantasy material than your favorite adult movie.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006LE7S", "parent_asin": "B00006LE7S", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1250797427000, "helpful_vote": 17, "verified_purchase": false}

This publication features outrageously priced merchandise and let's you, the reader, gaze in awe at some of the ways in which the fabulously wealthy spend their excess cash.<br /><br />I have been enjoying the Robb Report for about a year now and as I read each issue, I find myself alternating between various emotions. On one hand, the magazine offers a fascinating glimpse inside the buying world of the filthy rich. On the other hand, one has to wonder what would convince someone to spend huge sums of money on merchandise that, while certainly high in prestige, could still be obtained for much less money without sacrificing much quality. I realize the incredibly rich like their toys and need something on which to spend their cash, but some of these items go way over the top, to put it mildly. Items such as eight hundred dollar sunglasses or five thousand dollar watches are often highlighted in the pages of the Robb Report and while they certainly capture one's imagination, you have to question what would convince a person to spend so lavishly.<br /><br />Even though the Robb Report is a fantasy read for most people, it still has much to offer and one thing I like about this magazine is the writing. Not only is it top- notch, but these individuals really know what they are talking about and they are able to keep the writing on a level that makes living the good life seem ordinary. In other words, this magazine doesn't read like a shock piece- it assumes that the reader is already well- acquainted with living a life of luxury and may not even be that impressed by a one- thousand dollar writing utensil or a fifteen thousand dollar set of golf clubs. Another great quality of the Robb Report is the photography. It is absolutely superb, with illustrations that are vivid, clear, and inspiring in a fantasy type of way.<br /><br />Rich people like their toys, just like everyone else and the Robb Report fulfills their needs by presenting a quality magazine that is flawlessly written and exquisitely illustrated. It is a fantasy read for most people, but it performs its main mission quite nicely: Spotlighting extremely expensive merchandise for the highly affluent and offering a glimpse inside the lifestyle that many of the world's super rich enjoy every day.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIOP", "parent_asin": "B00005NIOP", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1247853720000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Poets and Writers Offers Inspiration and a Peak Into Writing Culture", "text": "Writers are usually on the lookout for information. They want to know how to succeed at the business of writing. They want to know how to promote themselves. They want tips and advice for success. Most turn to the world wide web for this, similar information but there are still a few traidtional avenues for writing advice, and one of them is magazines. Among magazines for writers, Poets & Writers Magazine is one of the better choices available. It brings the world of writing to your fingertips every two months with helpful articles about writing style, publication challenges, etc., along with interviews from established writers who are ready to share their secrets.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine concentrates a large percentage of its articles and advice on the world of poetry, so it makes a valuable resource for those who specialize in writing poems and want to expand on their talents. It also emphasizes fictional writing and each issue can be counted on for at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous fiction writer/poet. These writers are ready to share their successes and challenges with the reader and many will find these articles personable and inspiring.<br /><br />With the emphasis on fiction, some people might come away from Poets & Writers Magazine with a feeling of disappointment. I am one of those people who read and write nothing but non- fiction, so I was a little disappointed when I discovered that Poets & Writers contained so little material for non- fiction writers. However, I can still see the value of this magazine for all writers. Going back to the articles about specific writers, for example, one can quickly read about their struggles, successes, failures, etc. and relate them to any type of writing. And while there are not as many tips and advice columns as there are in other writing publications, there are still a few and they are pretty good, even if usually very general and obvious.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine contains plenty of advertisements. The ads focus on writing conferences, publishers, university degree programs, writing workshops, writing retreats, and other events. Some might argue that the pages contain too many advertisements, but since writers who read writing magazines are usually looking for ways to promote themselves, improve their education level, and perfect their art, it makes sense that advertisements are such an important part of the magazine. I know some people who grab a copy of Poets & writers magazine solely for the advertisements, so I cannot necessarily say this is a con. Unusual is the writer who doesn't want to grow and expand his/her craft through promotion and education so it makes sense that advertising is so prevalent in this type of magazine.<br /><br />Poets & Writers Magazine is a useful publication for writers- particularly those who write poetry and general fiction. The magazine is published entirely in black and white, except for the cover photo and some of the advertisements, and it offers a good deal of length per issue for your reading enjoyment. It is a magazien about writing culture as well as writing education and promotion and while it would be nice if it included more information for non- fiction writers, it still has many good things to offer and it makes a great gift choice for the aspiring poet and/or fictional author.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006KT0K", "parent_asin": "B00006KT0K", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1246251254000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}

This magazine is unique in that it focuses only on the sport of basketball. Most all other popular sporting magazines cover all types of sports from football to tennis and everything in between. But Dime Magazine is one- hundred percent basketball and it devotes its pages to the men and women behind the sport and what they are like when not playing the game. There is some talk about the sport itself, but Dime Magazine digs deeper than that. It strives to let the reader know about the basketball people themselves; what they are like, what they believe in, what their family life is like, etc.<br /><br />Dime Magazine covers basketball in every form, including college, NBA, WNBA, and world competition, but the majority of the articles cover the NBA and its many dazzling stars. Occasionally, Dime Magazine will offer an article on a woman who plays college hoops or a rising basketball star in another part of the world. But most of the stories revolve around the personalities that make the NBA what it is today. These personal stories are often very frank and very to the point. As most fans already know, the NBA has some very unique and powerful personalities among its personnel and these men do not hold back their feelings and do not resist massaging their own egos. They let you know exactly what they think, whether it's about basketball or some other subject.<br /><br />Dime Magazine is a very consistent magazine. Each issue contains about the same number of pages with sections laid out in roughly the same way. One quality that many will appreciate is the lack of advertisements. There is a fashion section near the end which is like an advertisement, but other than this, Dime Magazine devotes most of its pages to stories and interviews with the players. This publication wants to keep basketball enthusiasts informed about some of the most interesting players in the game and it wastes little time or magazine space deviating from its main purpose.<br /><br />Basketball fans are often die- hard and many individuals live and breathe the sport they love. Dime Magazine is a great publication for these intense fans of basketball because it goes much deeper than the game itself. Basketball is fun to watch, but there is more to the game than what one witnesses on the court. There are also the personalities that have helped shape the game of basketball and Dime Magazine is a nice publication for reading about and learning more about the interesting men and woman who have helped make basketball the cultural phenomenon that it is today.", "images": [], "asin": "B000069YWG", "parent_asin": "B000069YWG", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1231865804000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Build Your Dream Aircraft with Kitplanes", "text": "Kitplanes is a different kind of magazine and one that will only appeal to a limited audience. This magazine is intended for those who love airplanes and whose interest in airplanes reaches a level that goes beyond simply flying. Kitplanes takes aviation to a different level for a magazine by focusing on actually building aircraft. Kitplanes is more than just a mechanical read- it is also a creative read that explores the different ways that small aircraft can be built, the different designs, and the different styles and capabilities.<br /><br />Most of the pages in Kitplanes are dedicated to design and construction. From the initial mental blueprint to the proper hardware, Kitplanes wants to help the enthusiastic hobbyist construct the dream machine. Some of the articles in Kitplanes are educational in nature, focusing on the specifics of aerodynamics, the pros and cons of using different types of metals, etc. The magazine even includes some success stories from builders who have completed their aircraft construction and want to share their results with the reader.<br /><br />Mechanics are important, but in the day and age in which we live, technology is more important than ever and Kitplanes is right there to help. Small aircraft isn't as sophisticated as commercial aircraft, but the aircraft building hobbyist still wants to be as safe as possible, and Kitplanes offers plenty of tips on instrument panels, safety systems, and other things high tech in nature.<br /><br />One other interesting aspect of Kitplanes is that it's a very consistent magazine. Each issue I have read contains exactly 80 pages and the departments and most of the regular features are found on exactly the same page number each month. For those who like consistency and repetition, this is a nice feature for a magazine. But this will not sit well with people who like a little variety from time to time. I am one of the types who like some variety in my magazines, so the consistency is a strike against the magazine, even if only a small strike.<br /><br />Kitplanes is, overall, a pretty good magazine about a very expensive hobby. I find the articles pretty good, even though some are certainly better than others. Some are a little too brief and assume the builder needs guidance from start to finish but Kitplanes is still a useful magazine for those who dream about constructing their own airplane. It does have a few shortfalls, but for the flying enthusiast who dreams of constructing his/her own aircraft, Kitplanes is a magazine worth reading.", "images": [], "asin": "B00008GT1F", "parent_asin": "B00008GT1F", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1230746874000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Balancing Work and Home", "text": "Pink is a business magazine for women. It's a publication written and targeted to the successful career woman and it's a magazine I have been glancing through for the past several years. Pink discusses a myriad of topics that are important to the career female, including success and advancement in the workplace, to balance between home and career, to staying healthy so that the working woman can enjoy the fruits of her labor. This is a magazine that aims to show that women can be a successful business professional while also maintaining her sense of femininity. Traditional female traits and business success do not have to be mutually exclusive ideas. They can co- exist, and many women are quickly realizing that they, too,  can be soft and feminine while also holding a position of high prestige in their place of business.<br /><br />Because Pink is about business, a large number of the pages in each issue are dedicated to career development and some of these articles can offer good advice and inspiring wisdom. These success stories rank among the best articles in each issue. These women are ready to share their climb to the top with the reader, explaining what worked and what didn't work; the obstacles faced; and the ways in which they learned to balance their success in the workplace with their family life and other job as a concerned mother and parent.<br /><br />Most of the departments and other material in Pink are pretty good and there is some sound advice that can apply to anyone, whether male or female. But I must admit that I do get a little tired of the seeming battle of the sexes component of this magazine. Many of the articles deal with career obstacles, and this is fine. But they often portray the women as victims or possible victims; otherwise intelligent people who have to overcome many additional obstacles due to being a woman- obstacles that men supposedly do not need to worry about. The magazine almost seems to pit one side against the other and even if it is intended in an educational way, it takes away from the value of the magazine. I would rather read the positive aspects of being a career woman and how women have faced the challenges presented by their profession, regardless of whether the so- called obstacle is a man or a woman.<br /><br />Pink is, overall, a pretty good magazine for the career women who also has a family and wants to learn new ways to balance these competing realms of her life. It does tend to emphasize the male vs. female aspect of work a little more than I would prefer and when it does this, it sometimes makes the women seem like victims. But when Pink is sharing female business success stories or dispensing advice, it is a solid magazine that most any professional woman will appreciate and this fact alone makes Pink a publication worth reading.", "images": [], "asin": "B000K7KJXQ", "parent_asin": "B000K7KJXQ", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1226267712000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Can't Curb Your Enthusiasm? Read Cycle World!", "text": "Motorcycle enthusiasts are a unique breed and the main quality that sets them apart from the rest of civilization is their unyielding enthusiasm for their chosen sport/hobby. They often become consumed with biking and, like golf fanatics and others, they view every spare moment as an excuse to partake in their chosen activity.<br /><br />Cycle World is a magazine designed with the motorcycle enthusiast in mind. This publication is made for the type of biker who not only likes to ride his cycle, but also liked to learn as much about motorcycles as possible. There are, of course, plenty of articles in each issue of Cycle World that talk about the joys of riding and the sport of motorcycle racing. But Cycle World includes other articles, too- articles that only the well- rounded motorcycle fan will be likely to read and appreciate. Some articles focus on new technology. Others dispense advice on motorcycle repair. There are also travel articles and personality profiles as well, making for a nicely rounded publication.<br /><br />I'm not a motorcycle enthusiast or even a casual fan, but I still like certain sections of Cycle World and I try to read a few of them every month. My favorite sections of Cycle World are those that feature new products. Cycle World is among the first publications to report on new motorcycles and other related products and the magazine includes plenty of great photos, test data, and various statistics. In a matter of minutes, one can quickly learn the pros and cons of a specific motorcycle and more easily make a buying decision. Even though I am not a fan, I still like these articles because, like articles on new cars, they often include some very cool new product offerings that can easily impress anyone- even a nonfan like me.<br /><br />Motorcycles are loved by their many enthusiastic fans and Cycle World is a magazine intended for those who want a well- rounded publication about motorcycles, their upkeep, and their use for entertainment. Most of the pages in each issue are dedicated to the different motorcycles produced by different manufacturers, but there is plenty other information to be found in this magazine about motorcycles and Cycle World makes a good choice for those who want to know how to ride, repair, and enjoy their hobby as much as possible.", "images": [], "asin": "B00007AWME", "parent_asin": "B00007AWME", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1225305798000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Learn the Tools of the Writing Trade", "text": "Writer's Digest is a magazine designed for writers and it attempts to cover many different aspects of writing in its columns and featured articles. Most every issue offers at least one interview with a famous or semi- famous author. This spotlighted author could be the author of a book, a screen writer, or some other type of author. These interviews offer some good insight into writing success and the necessary skills and sacrifices to succeed at your chosen craft.<br /><br />Aside from the interviews, Writer's Digest is basically a magazine of tips and advice. One issue might talk about ways to break into the business of movie reviewing for newspapers. Another might talk about ways to make your writing more concise and less wordy. Still another article might discuss ways to overcome writer's block. The main goal of Writer's Digest is to help the reader become a better writer and, hopefully, gain an offer for a publication at some point in the future.<br /><br />One thing that is a little different with Writer's Digest is that it doesn't contain the long list of standard monthly departments like you find in other magazines. With Writer's Digest, the departments are de-emphasized and there are only a few of them in each issue. The rest of Writer's Digest is dedicated to columns and featured articles. This format is unique and it makes Writer's Digest a good choice for those who like change and prefer to read something different in each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest does contain a pretty good number of advertisements, but the ads are usually for writing conferences, writing software, writing contests, or ads that encourage a visit to the magazine's own web site. Because the ads stay so focused on the subject of writing, they don't seem all that bad and they are not distracting. I know some Writer's Digest readers who actually look forward to the ads so that they can find information on the latest contests. And speaking of the magazine's web site, it seems to be an important component of the magazine because it is referenced on many pages throughout each issue.<br /><br />Writer's Digest is a pretty good magazine for writer and I like it for its advice and classified ads more than anything. The success stories can sometimes get a bit carried away and they make it look a little too easy to land a huge writing contract. It would also be nice if Writer's Digest was published monthly rather than semi- monthly. But Writer's Digest is still a good magazine for writers everywhere, with plenty of good advice and tips to help you become the writer you always knew you could be.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIPH", "parent_asin": "B00005NIPH", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1219766847000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Modern Country Decor", "text": "Country Home is a magazine that does all it can to bring the country home to you, regardless of what type of setting in which you presently live. I am a city slicker all the way and I certainly have no interest in selling my home and purchasing a farm. But I still like Country Home magazine for several reasons. Most important of all, I like that Country Home doesn't completely push the country look and/or country lifestyle. This was a pleasant surprise when I started to read Country Home because, based on the name, I was expecting a magazine that was all about the country lifestyle, complete with recipes for grits, outhouse remodeling tips, and ideas for purchasing the best wicker furniture. But Country Home isn't like that at all. This magazine is certainly country- oriented, but it emphasizes a more modern country look for the home that can be applied to most any household, regardless of location.<br /><br />Country Home offers several different sections and different monthly features but the theme that the magazine continues to return to is that of home decorating. Turn to different sections of Country Home and you are most likely to see articles on antiques, collectibles, flowers, and other like items and how their inclusion can make your home look better. There are also some recipes offered in different parts of Country Home, and they offer some interesting recipes made southern style.<br /><br />Country Home certainly attempts to keep its country roots at a modern level, but that doesn't mean you won't find anything that is truly down home in the pages of Country Home. There are some very rustic suggestions for home decor in the pages of Country Home and some of them will likely turn off the majority of city- dwelling readers. When I read Country Home, I tend to flip past these articles because they are a little too down on the farm for my tastes. The other articles about home decorating are at least modern looking enough to consider, even though it is doubtful I would ever adopt one of the styles mentioned in this magazine.<br /><br />Country Home is, overall, a very good magazine and, coming from someone like me, that says a lot considering I have little or no interest in country life or the country theme for home decor. The reason I like the magazine regardless is because of the writing, the antique articles, the occasional travel article, and the collectibles ideas, not to mention the recipes. Combined together, Country Home offers a total greater than the sum of its parts and it makes for a very appealing magazine.", "images": [], "asin": "B000UHI32U", "parent_asin": "B000UHI32U", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1217048212000, "helpful_vote": 3, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Intellectually Stimulating and Highly Anticipated Each Month", "text": "The Atlantic is an intellectual magazine and one that I have been reading on and off for many years. This magazine is best known for its political/current events/social articles that tackle some tough issues of the day and it delivers most effectively when it's offering some commentary on world events and social issues and these are the articles I turn to first when I read The Atlantic. I like the political articles best, but there are plenty of other non- political yet very thoughtful articles in each issue.<br />Most every article in The Atlantic is thoughtful and well- written. Look closely at the authors of some of the stories in this magazine and you will notice some high- profile names on more than one occasion. Christopher Hitchens, Mark Bowden, Eric Schlosser, and others are known to contribute an article or two in each issue of The Atlantic. These writers, and others like them, are ready to offer their take on some of the critical issues of the day.<br /><br />The Atlantic certainly offers some interesting, thoughtful, intellectual articles and one fact that sets them apart from those found in most other magazines is that the featured articles are often very long- sometimes exceeding ten pages in length. Most magazines shy away from articles this long because they know that most reader's have an attention span that is far too short to finish the entire piece of reading in one sitting. But The Atlantic is different. If the subject matter is such that an article needs to be ten- plus pages in order to thoroughly cover everything, then The Atlantic is quick to oblige. I appreciate the excellent coverage but I must admit that some articles are almost too long. Even when I have an interest in the subject matter, I often end up stopping halfway through because I cannot hold my attention any longer.<br /><br />Another section I like in The Atlantic is the book reviews section. To present a fair and balanced perspective, The Atlantic reviews new books from many different genres and I like that there are different reviews of varying lengths. One section of The Atlantic called Cover to Cover includes short summaries of many different books. These are nice when you don't have time to read a lengthy review of a book and just want the basics. But there are also some very long book reviews in The Atlantic, along with some advertisements for new books that include a short, 50 to 100 word summary of the book. I like reading the reviews, but I like this section best for its exposure to new book releases. It is like looking at a quick rundown of intellectual books and I have, in fact, discovered some very good titles from this part of the magazine.<br /><br />Overall, The Atlantic ranks among my favorite magazines and I look forward to some serious, intellectual reading in each issue. I admit that some articles are a tad too lengthy, but I still like The Atlantic for its intellectual stimulation and for its focus on current events. It's a very good magazine for cerebral types who like to read about politics and social issues.", "images": [], "asin": "B000UHI2LW", "parent_asin": "B000UHI2LW", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1214419310000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Barron's Offers Timely Financial Updates and Great Writing", "text": "Barron's is a popular magazine/newspaper that helps investors keep abreast of financial markets, industry news, economic trends, profit forecasts, and other related topics. This publication bills itself as the magazine of the Dow Jones, and it offers investors and other financial gurus some solid and timely financial reading.<br /><br />Many people who read Barron's head directly to the Market Week section in order to catch up on the latest investment prices. Each weekly issue of Barron's offers plenty of stock tables, Commodities Pricing, Options market pricing, etc., so it makes sense that a concerned investor would turn to this section first, in order to check investment prices. But Barron's is much more than a collection of statistical tables. Each issue contains a large number of featured articles and regular columns and there are very few departments. The bulk of each issue is dedicated to short articles about specific companies, economic concerns, innovative technology, Wall Street trends, and other noteworthy topics.<br /><br />Barron's is a very expensive publication, but among its many good points is the fact that it is published weekly and therefore is very up to date and timely. If you're an investor, you are fully aware of the importance of timely information and Barron's provides exactly that. Whether the subject is the high price of oil, corporate takeovers, or volatile interest rates, Barron's is right there, offering a timely article about the important issues of the day.<br />One other noticeable fact about Barron's is that devotes only a minimal amount of space to advertisements. There are some ads, and they are usually clustered in the first part of each issue. Most all of the ads are relevant to the subject matter of the magazine, and it is common to see ads for insurance companies, mutual funds, brokerage services, and the like. Because the ads are almost all about finance, they tend to blend into the articles and you do not notice them like you notice the ads in other magazines.<br /><br />Investors, financial professionals, and concerned citizens like to keep up to date on financial and economic affairs and for these individuals, Barron's ranks as one of the best financial publications available today. The articles are quite thorough for such a short magazine and while some articles can get a little too advanced for the novice investor, there is still much to be learned in every issue of Barron's. Timely financial data, great writing, and relevant articles make Barron's a magazine worth reading for those with an interest in the subject of finance and investments.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006F2SY", "parent_asin": "B00006F2SY", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1206113606000, "helpful_vote": 20, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Maximizing Electronics Enjoyment", "text": "Maximum PC is a magazine for electronics freaks, offering many different articles about electronics; how to buy them, how to repair them, how to get the most out of them, and how best to replace them. This magazine is aimed in one primary direction: Making the most out of the electronic devices available. This is accomplished through the many instructional articles, how to guides, and question and answer sessions.<br /><br />When Maximum PC isn't offering words of wisdom on ways to improve your life with electronics, the magazine is usually offering reviews of new products. The reviews section is one of the largest parts of each issue and while it does a nice job bringing new products to the forefront, the reviews are often less than stellar. Rather than analyze a few products in- depth, Maximum PC instead prefers to offer shorter reviews of many products. This part of the magazine seems more concerned with quantity than quality, in contrast to most of the remainder of the magazine.<br /><br />One thing about Maximum PC that isn't to my liking is the technical nature of many articles. Maximum PC likes to get to the root of things (literally), and it is common to find articles talking about circuits, memory, and other boring subjects. This is fine for those who take their technology to the extremes, but I have no interest in learning about the inter-workings of the wiring inside my personal computer or the electronic pulses that cause my printer to respond on queue. This is a little too much technology for me, but I know there are some readers who will relish the depths that Maximum PC goes to when it strips down electronic devices into their component parts.<br /><br />Overall, Maximum PC is a pretty good electronics magazine for young and middle- aged adults. It loses me from time to time when it gets overly technical, but it still ranks as a good magazine about electronics. The numerous question and answer sessions, the educational articles, and the product reviews make this a magazine worth reading.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7P0", "parent_asin": "B00005N7P0", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1190665602000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

Based on the popular PBS television program, this magazine aims to help its readers find new and better ways to improve the home and perform routine maintenance.<br /><br />Magazines and the internet are my primary sources when home repair reaches the critical point. This Old House is one of several magazines I like to read and it is the one I turn to most frequently when I need to find out about home maintenance. The majority of other home- related publications deal strictly with enhancements, remodeling, and general improvement. This Old House offers these types of articles, along with articles on general home repair, landscaping techniques, utility cost savings, and more.<br /><br />My favorite departments in This Old House are \"Around the House\", \"Toolbox\", and \"Salvage\". The last department, Salvage, sounds boring at first but it often gets very creative. This department selects a common household item- usually one that is probably slated to get tossed in the trash- and points out a creative way to re- use the item. Some of the ideas they come up with are surprising, making this one of the first sections I turn to when I get a new issue in the mail.<br /><br />Some parts of This Old House are not appealing at all, either because the suggestions are far too costly for someone like me; because they involve skills that I do not possess; or a combination of the two. The Luxury department is one such area. Another is the Design sections. These areas are intended for the more advanced home improver who has advanced skills at home design. There are some very expensive suggestions, too, and these parts of the magazine provide more fantasy reading than anything. However, there are still enough less expensive ideas to keep the magazine useful and practical.<br /><br />Overall, This Old House is a good magazine that offers some home improvement ideas, some repair suggestions, and some ways to enhance your home's value. The general repair advice is pretty handy and while I don't have much use for other parts of the magazine, I can agree that these are helpful to the right type of person. It makes This Old House a good publication for those who seek advice for home repair and home enhancement.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005R8BL", "parent_asin": "B00005R8BL", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1190152066000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}

This magazine is a little bit big business and a little bit personal finance, combining together the features of a business magazine with that of an investment publication.<br /><br />One of the main things I like about Smart Money is the fact that it includes so many different articles each month. There are only a few regular departments in this magazine. The majority of the pages include featured articles and short articles that change from month to month. These articles can cover a wide range of topics from ways to cut your electric bill to the latest regulations in the insurance industry.<br /><br />Smart Money is an intelligent magazine and its articles are often a little more advanced than those of other financial publications. They don't reach a level that is too advanced to make them incapable of understanding, and that is good. But they are certainly intended for the savvier investor who already knows the ropes and wants some more specific, intermediate to advanced advice on personal finance and corporate happenings.<br /><br />Overall, I rank Smart Money as a very good personal finance magazine and it is one I will continue to read when I get the chance. It is like a combination of Fortune and Money magazines and its timely articles are often very interesting and helpful. Whether it's an article on reducing your cell phone bill or an article about the profit picture in the oil business, Smart Money is certain to inform and enlighten.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7SS", "parent_asin": "B00005N7SS", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1184234382000, "helpful_vote": 19, "verified_purchase": false}

This magazine offers a way to find out dates for upcoming operas; backgrounds on some of the more popular opera stars; reviews of operas and opera related media; interviews; etc.<br /><br />I am not a man of the arts by any stretch and it's a rare day that finds me sitting in a theater seat, watching a bunch of stage performers sing and dance. But I still like Opera News nonetheless and I can understand fully why fans of opera enjoy it so much. It covers the big operas, the big stars, and much more.<br /><br />Articles about specific performers are common in this magazine but Opera News isn't just a magazine about opera performers and the long hours they labor for their chosen profession. No, this magazine offers more than that and there is something for any lover of entertainment to enjoy. There are plenty of reviews of operas, DVD, CD, and books; interviews with stars; and plenty of news and official information. The fact that the name of the magazine includes the word \"News\" is no accident, for Opera News is exactly that: a news source for all things opera and opera related.<br /><br />Since I have limited interest in watching operas, I tend to gloss over the interviews and bios (I have no idea who these people are anyway). My favorite sections are those that cover news stories and the reviews at the end of the magazine. The news articles are usually good and I like the featured articles that talk about opera history and other like topics. And, as an avid reader, I like reading the book reviews even though I am unlikely to ever purchase one of these books.<br /><br />Overall, Opera News is a magazine that every opera lover should read. I am not a fan of opera and theater but even I have found some reading value with this magazine.

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Reeling in a Record - Setting Catch", "text": "Bassmaster is a magazine about fishing and it likes to boast that it is the \"Worldwide Authority on Bass Fishing\". This magazine divides its focus among different areas, like finding/fishing for bass, buying the best equipment, and keeping pace with the different sporting tournaments that focus on bass fishing.<br /><br />I spend very little time participating in outdoor sports but I have been known to cast a reel over an expanse of water on an infrequent occasion. With Bassmaster, consumers like me can quickly get the information needed to find places to fish for bass. There is also plenty of tips and advice from Bassmaster magazine and from fishing professionals. They clue you in on the right environment and weather conditions for bass fishing, the best equipment to use, and the most effective lure to improve your chances for landing that prized catch.<br /><br />Bassmaster is like other sporting magazines in many ways, but it differs a little from other fishing magazines, mainly in its coverage of the sport of bass fishing. Part of the reason for the emphasis on sports is Bassmaster's affiliation with sports authority ESPN.  ESPN is the main reason the sporting aspect gets the amount of coverage in Bassmaster that it does and it helps make the magazine that much better to read.<br /><br />Bassmaster is loaded with different departments and among all the magazines I read each month, Bassmaster probably has more departments than any other publication of similar length. The departments are short- usually covering only one page each- but they offer some of the magazine's best and easiest to read material. Departments like \"Ask the Experts\", \"Bass Basics\", and others are good for finding some quick information on fishing and how to make it more enjoyable and more successful. I like the Destinations section, too, because it offers some information on lakes and rivers that would make good choices for vacationing as well as fishing.<br /><br />I don't fish very often and I'm not someone that would be classified as an outdoorsman, but I still like Bassmaster magazine. It offers some good writing and compelling articles about bass fishing, both as a casual hobby and as a competitive sport. If someone like me- a person who doesn't even fish very much- can find reasons to enjoy reading a magazine like Bassmaster, just think of how much a true fan of this activity will like this publication. It's one of the better fishing magazines and it makes a good choice of gift for a dedicated fisherman; offering plenty of good reading each month all for a low subscription cost.", "images": [], "asin": "B000EQ4010", "parent_asin": "B000EQ4010", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1175988534000, "helpful_vote": 6, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "GQ: Different From the Past, but Still Okay", "text": "GQ magazine has been around for a long time and, like other men's magazines, it has changed over the years. In an effort to attract more readers, GQ has spiced up some of its articles with more sex and it is common to find a scantily clad female on the cover- a place that used to be reserved exclusively for men. This isn't to say that the articles have suffered greatly from the changeover. There are still several good articles in each issue of GQ, combined with a few too many articles about relationships.<br /><br />When GQ is at its best is when the magazine is talking politics, entertainment, and/or culture. I have read many interesting political articles in GQ, ranging from topics like homeland security to men's rights when it comes to abortion. The entertainment articles are also quite good and the GQ team can be counted on to deliver some good, frank discussion about movies, books, movies, Hollywood celebrities, etc.<br /><br />GQ used to seem a little more fashion oriented than it is today. There are still several fashion related articles in each issue but the difference is that the GQ of today contains articles in a wider range of topics than in the past. This is fine by me, because the fashion articles rank low on my list of reading priorities. I would much rather read, say, an article that debates the efforts to ban smoking than an article about buying the right shoes to wear in a business casual workplace.<br /><br />Many magazines skimp when it comes to reading material but not GQ. You get your money's worth with this magazine. Each issue is the length of a book, with anywhere from 250 to 350 or more pages per issue and from 25 to 30 different featured articles, departments, and monthly columns to read (combined). This makes for a lot of reading. Even of you take the advertisement space into account, there is still plenty to read in each issue. It also means that, whatever your fancy, you should find something interesting to read every month.<br /><br />Overall, GQ is a good magazine for men and it contains some decent entertainment news, political analysis, and fashion tips. It is aimed at men in their early thirties and while I don't like it as much as similar publications I still think GQ is a decent magazine. Its long length makes it easily worth the low cost and with so much reading material, there is something for everyone in each issue. What others have said is true: It isn't the magazine it once was. But there is still enough of the good stuff to recommend this publication.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7QI", "parent_asin": "B00005N7QI", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1175306244000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Antiques Magazine is Good, but not for Everyone", "text": "Antiques Magazine is a publication made for antique lovers and history buffs and its pages are loaded with photos of artistic paintings, handmade goods, rare pictures, and other items of similar nature. It is a magazine for those who love antiques and also those who consider themselves historians since many articles deal with historical collections of art and antiques.<br /><br />This magazine is overflowing with antique goods and information. The articles contained in this magazine are intended to be visually stimulating in some cases, educational in others. They offer history lessons on the art that was popular during a specific era, a glimpse into an art collection at a museum, and more. The articles are meant to stimulate the interests of those who already like this subject and they often provide a means to learn more, to discover places to see or purchase some of the featured works, and to develop an appreciation for the craftsmanship that went into making these items.<br /><br />Antiques Magazine is a publication dedicated to creative art and history but one thing that isn't very creative is the titles of the articles. This might surprise some readers at first, but the editors at Antiques decided to get straight to the point in the naming of the featured articles rather than try to be creative. The features thus have titles like \"The Eating Utensil Collection\", \"Spanish Culture in Art\", etc. Each title points out exactly what the article covers, leaving nothing to the imagination.<br /><br />The writing in Antiques is certainly good and well- edited. But I'm afraid that many readers will find the articles a little boring. They describe things well and they usually offer a good history lesson. But they lack spark and readability. I have tried to read some articles in this magazine and found my eyelids getting heavy and my thoughts drifting to other subjects. This is why I generally stick with the pictures when I glance at Antiques Magazine. I don't bother reading because most of the material doesn't keep my interest.<br /><br />Overall, Antiques Magazine is an okay publication and unless you have a deep interest in antiques and their history, you will likely become bored quickly if you try to read the articles. But the pictures in Antiques are often very interesting. Even if you have little interest in reading a magazine like this one, the photos alone make it worth an occasional look.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7OJ", "parent_asin": "B00005N7OJ", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1174763405000, "helpful_vote": 13, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Your Guide to Improvement", "text": "If you are the type of golfer who wants to improve your putting, your swing, your choice of equipment, or anything else golf related, then Golf Tips is the magazine for you. This magazine, unlike other golf publications, dedicates almost all of its pages to improvement. Most every golfer wants to get better over time, and Golf Tips is one of the few publications available that focuses all of its contents on self improvement.<br /><br />As far as the advice goes, Golf Tips is a good magazine and it tries to cover several different aspects of the game in the same issue, so readers can find a relevant article that relates to their own problems. Maybe your problem area is putting. If it is, there is likely a putting article someone in the current issue. Another person might be having trouble perfecting his/her swing and if so, there are plenty of helpful articles that include diagrams so readers will know exactly what to do.<br /><br />Other magazines include diagrams to illustrate proper maneuvering of the hands and body when swinging a golf club but Golf Tips takes this a step further. It includes not only picture depicting the right way to do it, there are also pictures showing what not to do. With some of these, Golf Tips will make sure the casual reader knows which photo depicts the wrong way to swing by showing a red circle with a line through it (same symbol seen on certain traffic signs), superimposed over the picture. With an illustration like this, there will be no doubt in the golfer's mind what he/she is not supposed to do.<br /><br />Overall, Golf Tips is a good magazine for someone whose primary interest is improving his/her game. There are other magazines that include some instruction on the game, but Golf Tips concentrates most all of its pages in this area. I prefer a more balanced golf magazine like Golf Digest but I can see how Golf Tips could come in handy. The advice is written like a pro, and it covers something about many different problems in each and every issue.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006J9HV", "parent_asin": "B00006J9HV", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1174762778000, "helpful_vote": 15, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Wired for the Modern World", "text": "Wired is a semi- interesting magazine that blends together articles about technology with those on politics, culture, and more. This magazine is aimed at a diverse audience but it generally caters to those who are technology savvy and like to keep up with the latest world events.<br /><br />Wired dedicates most of its pages to the discussion of electronics and other technology and computer nerds form a large percentage of the magazine's core subscribers. Articles about digital cameras, high definition televisions, internet marketing, and other like topics can be found in every issue. These articles often present unique angles on common problems and concerns in the world of high tech.<br /><br />What makes Wired interesting is the fact that it includes other articles on other subjects- topics that one normally would not associate with a technology magazine. It is common to find articles about popular culture, politics, and other topics and they sometimes seem out of place. One minute you're reading an article about PDA's and the next minute you're reading an article about the war against Iraq. It's a little weird but it also makes for a nice change of pace as you read.<br /><br />Another interesting fact with Wired is that it changes its authors more frequently than other magazines. The magazine has a few regulars but it likes to shuffle the writers around each month. This can be good and it can result in articles that present new and different perspectives each month. But it also means that the magazine is a little uneven and can sometimes include articles that do not communicate the way they should. I can recall reading several articles that left me scratching my head, wondering why the editor didn't make additional changes so that the articles were clearer.<br /><br />The departments in Wired cover a large percentage of the space in every issue and they exceed the total length of many other magazines' department sections. The departments (with the exception of one) occupy the first two- thirds of each issue. The monthly featured articles are found near the end of each issue. This layout is different from other magazines that mix the departments and monthly features together. With Wired, the departments and featured articles are kept separate.<br /><br />Overall, I like Wired as a whole and the political articles rank as my favorite part of each issue. The magazine jumps around from topic to topic and the authors change more frequently than other magazines; two facts that could make Wired a little too scattered for certain readers. Some of the articles are not the best written I have ever seen but Wired is still a good enough magazine to recommend. It keeps readers current on technology, politics, business, and entertainment with a reputation for being modern and hip.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7TL", "parent_asin": "B00005N7TL", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1163620402000, "helpful_vote": 5, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Boating Adventures and Buying Advice", "text": "Boating Life is a publication about boating adventure and recreation and it dedicates most of its pages to boating enjoyment, product reviews, equipment reviews, and general advice. In many ways, this magazine is like a buying guide for boats. Not only does it contain many pages of product reviews, it also includes many featured articles that focus on the specifics of different boats (speed capability, length, miles per gallon, etc.), making it a good choice for reading material for those who are in the market for a new boat.<br /><br />Besides acting as a selling agent, Boating Life is also a magazine about adventure and it is common to find articles about specific bodies of water and how best to enjoy them; tales of long adventures on large lakes; and popular events around the nation where the best views are often those from a small water- going vessel. These rank among my favorite articles in each issue because they are more personal in nature and they get your imagination running.<br /><br />One thing I like and respect about Boating Life is that, unlike many other boating magazines, it keeps things on a realistic level. That is, it doesn't devote the majority of its pages to boats that only the rich can afford to buy. It offers reviews and advice on a wide range of boats, from an inexpensive fishing boat designed for two to a large expensive yacht that can hold ten or more guests. I don't mind reading about these more expensive boats from time to time, but they are more fantasy than anything. With Boating Life, there are many pages of ordinary boats that anyone can afford.<br /><br />Boating Life is a nice magazine overall and it makes a good choice for people who are in the market for a new boat or for those who already own a boat and want some advice on how best to maintain them and how best to enjoy them. Boating Life offers good reviews and facts about specific boats and, along with the adventure articles, it makes a good choice of magazine for the boating enthusiast.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIPO", "parent_asin": "B00005NIPO", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1158422007000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Bridging the Gap Between Hispanics and Americans", "text": "Latina is a cultural magazine designed to appeal to the modern, trendy Hispanic woman who resides in the USA. This magazine features a mixture of entertainment, fashion, and practical advice on topics ranging from personal finance to family life and its primary audience is young woman, both married and single.<br /><br />This magazine is designed with the female consumer in mind but there are several departments and monthly features that offer more widespread appeal. Latina Life, for example, is a collection of articles in each issue that contains many relevant articles offering good reading that will appeal to a broad range of people. Here, the reader can find articles about money, health, fitness, travel, and other subjects that most anyone can relate. In addition to this, it is common to find articles that focus on specific Latina women (both celebrity and non- celebrity) who have overcome adversity. These are often the best articles in each magazine because they often present inspirational stories where a challenge or difficult circumstance was overcome. These articles offer good reading that can apply to anyone regardless of age or gender.<br /><br />Most of the remaining featured articles in Latina are geared in the direction of strictly feminine topics and I tend to skip over these when I read. These articles talk about things such as manicures, hair styling, clothing selection, and other things that are intended for the female market. But in spite of the limited appeal, there is one thing that men will like: The photos. These articles about women and their fashion options are usually accompanied by plenty of pictures of hot Latin babes making them worthy of a look or two.<br /><br />Advertisements are common in this magazine and one interesting fact is that part of the ads are written in Spanish. This is only true, however, of the ads- the articles themselves are all composed in English. This surprised me when I first read Latina because I always thought the magazine contained English and Spanish in equal or nearly equal quantities and that Spanish was used in some of the featured articles. This isn't true, and while Latina does try to bridge the gap between Hispanic and American differences it is obvious that Latina assumes its readers already know a good deal of English.<br /><br />Latina contains a large amount of reading material that has little or no relevance to men but it redeems itself by including a good deal of articles that can appeal to anyone. There is an emphasis on stories relating to Latin women who have achieved success and overcome barriers and these are usually Latina's best articles. The personal touch is nice and the reading is inspiring. But most of the magazine is geared toward women and for this reason most men will not rate Latina very highly. I'm going to rate this publication with a small recommendation nonetheless because I can see its value and I can understand how the female market would enjoy this magazine.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005V3E8", "parent_asin": "B00005V3E8", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1157824985000, "helpful_vote": 4, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Enticing Photos and Great Articles", "text": "Coastal Living is a professionally- made magazine with lots of enticing photographs, personal stories, and general advice on making the most out of life on the coast. The emphasis in Coastal Living is on waterfront property and the events and entertainment that often take place in cities with a large coastal area.<br /><br />Much of what you read in Coastal Living pertains to better- known waterfront areas in the United States. Such popular destinations as Boston, Miami, New York, Long Island, California, Cape Cod, South Padre Island, and other tourist- oriented places comprise a large portion of the featured articles in this magazine. Many of these places (like New York City) have very expensive waterfront property than can often be next to impossible to buy. But these areas also include lots of tourist activities, which is why they are so frequently highlighted in this magazine.<br /><br />Besides the well- known destinations, Coastal Living also includes a good number of featured articles on lesser- known places. Many of these lack the fast- pace and the extensive nightlife of the more popular destinations, but they also offer better deals on property and an opportunity to get away from the chaos of the larger cities. Such places as the Delaware coast, Michigan, Ohio's Lake Erie coast, and others are often very quaint and interesting. Also, they offer property that is far more reasonable in price and is often within the affordability range for many buyers.<br /><br />Much of the properties you see and read about in Coastal Living are quite expensive. But remember- the majority of the homes are on major coastlines, so you can't expect to find them for selling for a low cost. These are high- demand, low supply properties and they vary greatly in price, but they are all expensive. In a popular area, these homes can sell up to the tens of millions of dollars. But in less popular areas, you can sometimes find some bargain prices on waterfront property. For example, Coastal Living has highlighted many Great Lakes properties that are priced very close to the overall U.S. average. They are not as cheap as most areas of the inner cities, no. But they are priced within the reach of many families.<br /><br />The emphasis in Coastal Living seems to be on properties- both main residences and vacation properties that are adjacent to a major coastline. But there are other items promoted for sale besides property. And much of this other merchandise is also quite costly. In the \"Currents\" section, for example, it is common to find things like lawn furniture, cufflinks, fancy pitchers, and other things selling for many times the usual price. Most of it is intended for those who want a little bit more and are willing (and able) to pay the price.<br /><br />Coastal Living is a personal magazine. Most of the stories involve families and couples who enjoy the coast. They share with the reader such things as how they keep their homes protected from the sea, what they do for entertainment, how they like to decorate, and why living on the coast means so much to them. Photos of families and couples often grace the pages of these types of articles, giving them a friendly, domestic feel.<br /><br />Most of what you will find in Coastal Living relates to the United States coast. There is only an occasional article about other coastal areas, like those of Mexico, the Caribbean, and other places. True, you will sometimes find an article about Hawaii or Alaska. But for the most part, Coastal Living tries to keep its journalism concentrated on places that lie within close proximity to the majority of Americans.<br /><br />Overall, Coastal Living is a very good magazine for people who enjoy vacationing on the coast, finding entertainment on the coast and, of course, living on the coast. The photography and presentation are excellent and it's interesting to read about the big- city life on the coast as well as some of the more \"unknown\" destinations. It provides great reading and a useful reference for people who already live on the coast or who are interested in purchasing waterfront property.", "images": [], "asin": "B000EGCIW8", "parent_asin": "B000EGCIW8", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1153771169000, "helpful_vote": 41, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 2.0, "title": "Lots of Photos and Ads, Little Content", "text": "Interview is definitely a different type of magazine for me- someone who usually reads business and travel mags- and it's not quite what I expected. With a title like \"Interview\" I read my first copy of this magazine anticipating pages and pages of nothing but interviews. It turns out that interviewing is the main focus of the magazine, but it's not the only one. There is substantial space given to fashion, movies, and other areas, too. Some of these columns are worth an occasional look, but they failed to grab my attention. The writers seem to play it safe, and that includes the interview section. They don't ask many daring or controversial questions. They keep it simple, asking questions about an entertainer's latest album or movie, without delving much into their personal lives.<br /><br />Interview has many general annoyances. My greatest complaint is the advertising and the arrangement of the contents. About half of the pages in each issue are covered with ads, with fashion, liquor, beer, and hair care items providing the bulk of the advertising revenue. The ads are everywhere, with the majority in the front pages of each issue. The table of contents is buried, and I find this very frustrating. The contents starts with the interviews for that specific issue on one page, then a few pages later, proceeds to the remainder of the contents, which is the regular monthly features. What's annoying is that you have to search for the table of contents. It varies from one issue to the next, falling somewhere in the first half.<br /><br />Interview also varies greatly in length. Some issues are as short as 80 pages while others are more than 200 pages long. The shorter issues use staples for binding while the longer issues are bound in a more professional way, minus any metal.<br /><br />This magazine centers on entertainers, fashion, music, and the like. You won't find any interviews with politicians, businessmen, etc. Interview sticks strictly to entertainers, and that includes the regular monthly columns. You won't find a column about the business side of the music industry or film industry. You will find only articles about the stars themselves.<br /><br />Interview's only saving grace is the photography. It would make a nice gift for those who enjoy fashion and who like looking at pages and pages of men and women modeling fancy clothing. But in many ways, the photos are overemphasized and there isn't enough substance to the magazine. The articles are very shallow with more eye candy than reading material.<br /><br />Overall, Interview is sloppy and cluttered with too many ads to make it worthwhile reading material. My subscription was free, and I'm thankful that it was. Besides a few nice photos for clothing, there isn't much to make this magazine worth the cost.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7NY", "parent_asin": "B00005N7NY", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1153770772000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Clean Male Entertainment", "text": "Cigar Aficionado is a surprising magazine that I have been enjoying now for the past six months. I rarely smoke cigars or any other form of tobacco so when I first heard about this magazine I was naturally skeptical. I wasn't expecting much because due to my limited experience with smoking and the fact that I have limited knowledge about cigars. I figured this magazine would make its way into my `magazine mound' in the corner of my living room- a place where I toss most of the dozens of periodicals I receive each month.<br /><br />But after paging through the first issue, my opinion of this magazine changed drastically. The reason?- Cigar Aficionado is not strictly a magazine about cigars, like I assumed it would be. It is actually an entertainment magazine that devotes the majority of its pages to a wide range of topics like sports, cars, travel, fashion, and other like subjects. In one issue, you can read about all sorts of varied topics with article titles like \"Best Ski Resorts\", \"Winning at Poker\", \"The New Face of Sports Management\", etc. This caught me completely by surprise and I'm sure I'm not the only reader out there who felt this way when he/she read this magazine for the first time. Its title leads one to conclude that it is strictly about cigars but that isn't the case at all.<br /><br />My favorite parts of this magazine are the travel and drink sections. I like to partake in an occasional beer and I love to travel so I naturally gravitate toward these two sections. But even in the areas where I wouldn't normally have much interest I have found myself attracted to the articles anyway, thanks to the quality writing and photography. One such feature that I find myself accidentally enjoying is \"Profile\"- a two or three page monthly feature that casts the spotlight on a celebrity who enjoys puffing on a good cigar. The celebrity (who can be anyone in sports, television, movies, or music) will talk about his/her career and the smokes he/she enjoys the most.<br /><br />Even though this is a multi- faceted entertainment magazine, cigar lovers will enjoy the ratings and buying guide information found in each issue. The magazine's own panel of experts blind tests each of several dozen smokes in each issue and then assigns a rating from zero to one- hundred points. The cigars are then sorted by category in descending order based on score, complete with tasting notes on each; the size; and the price. At the end of the ratings, you will find the same list organized by country of origin followed by another rating list called \"Connoisseur's Corner\" that includes more ratings of unique smokes. The only thing that could make this section better is more buying information. There is no web site, phone number, or other contact information provided. All you have is the name of the cigar and the price. It's up to you to find the cigar if you want to make a purchase.<br /><br />This magazine's subtitle is \"The Good Life Magazine for Men\". As such, there are only a few articles to be found that will interest the majority of women. Even the interviews (and the profile section) are usually written about men and from a man's point of view. About the only thing missing from this magazine is sex. That's right- you will find all sorts of things that are of interest to men in this magazine except for the most important one of all. I guess the editors of Cigar Aficionado decided that there are already enough magazines that cater to man's natural animal instincts and they concluded that devoting the space in each issue to other indulgences was sufficient.<br /><br />Overall, Cigar Aficionado is a very good magazine about entertainment. It costs more than other magazines but it is also much longer than most, with some issues approaching 350 pages. It offers a wide range of articles about living the good life, with excellent photography and entertaining writing that will appeal to the majority of men in all age groups.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7UC", "parent_asin": "B00005N7UC", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1150863584000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Give Me the Details", "text": "Details is a mildly interesting magazine that is geared toward men of various ages and lifestyles. The main group that Details aims to capture is the 17 to 35 year- old male but there are articles in each magazine that could be appealing to men of many different ages, mostly in the middle to upper income groups.<br /><br />Some things about Details quickly set it apart from other magazines. One difference is the \"departments\". Most magazines have departments, but instead of talking about the same things each month, these departments vary in their content (the only exceptions being \"Know- Tell\" and the \"The Details\"). Each one contains similar stories from one month to the next, but with different subtitles, helping to make each issue a little fresher than it would otherwise be.<br /><br />As far as the writing goes, Details offers a great deal of diversity for a magazine. Yes, it is generally focused on things of interest to men, but it covers a very broad range of interests. You can find articles in this magazine on such diverse topics as the death penalty, raising kids, buying a new coat, setting up an internet business, breaking up with a girlfriend, or purchasing the best vodka. There are articles geared toward single men and married men, as well as younger men and middle- aged men.<br /><br />I like some of the articles found here but there is one problem I have with the writing in Details. It is common to find eye- catching headlines on the cover of Details that tempt you to find out more. This is nothing new and most every magazine does this. But the problem is that many of these eye- popping stories fail to keep you amazed when you read them. Take for example an article in a recent issue. On the front, it reads \"Is Your Wife a Bad Mom\"? It sound like an engaging, intellectual read. But once you find the article and take in its 1,000+ words, you quickly discover that there is little or no substance. Basically, it simply tells men that accusing your wife of being a bad mom is a risky undertaking that could hurt her feelings. That is it. There is no intellectual analysis or quotes from studies; only the bottom line conclusion that mothers generally don't like to be called incompetent by their husbands. Other headlining articles in this magazine lead to similar disappointment.<br /><br />The writing in this magazine is on the edge and very blunt. It is common to find several four- letter words in many of the articles and while this doesn't bother me at all, I know that some readers will consider it too raw, too edgy, and too explicit. Details writers have no problem telling it like it is, and this can be both good and bad depending on one's perspective.<br /><br />Besides the language, some parts of this magazine could offend certain readers; namely the \"Anthropology\" page at the end. This closing \"article\" is meant to be humorous, but some readers will not see it that way. I don't know if it has always been this way, but what \"Anthropology\" does is show a person or multiple people and then asks the question \"Gay or ______\". For example, I have seen titles like \"Gay or Best Friends?\", \"Gay or Cowboy?\", \"Gay or Neo Punk Rocker?\", and others. With each of these, there is a diagram of sorts with arrows pointing to different clothing and bodily features and short comments about each one. Basically, it is asking you to think about these different attributes of the person or people in the picture and then decide if the way they dress, look, and act makes them gay. I find this silly and immature, but I can see how some readers would find it insulting. I don't know if Details has always done this or if the Anthropology page has been different in the past. But this is how it has been in every issue I have read and it needs to be changed.<br /><br />Advertisements claim about sixty percent of the pages in each issue of this magazine. They cover products like liquor, cars, electronics, cigarettes, fragrance, etc. Even though this magazine covers lots of different things, the item most often featured in the advertisements is clothing. The magazine seems to have a penchant for high fashion and it devotes more pages to expensive clothing than anything else. And each issue often has its own unique smell, thanks to all of the cologne samples. You can flip through the pages and find several samples in each issue, with many of the latest and trendiest scents from the biggest names in cologne.<br /><br />Overall, I am torn between liking or not liking Details Magazine. I like some of the articles on food, drink, politics and the like. But I don't necessarily like the shallow fluff that is often substituted for an intellectual discussion and I can understand how some readers would find certain aspects of this magazine insulting. This magazine is deserving of only about two and one- half stars which I will round up to three stars and give a small recommendation. Some will like this magazine and some will not. It's all a matter of what you like to read about and whether or not you can handle a magazine that pushes the envelope.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7PS", "parent_asin": "B00005N7PS", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1142485471000, "helpful_vote": 94, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Sunset Fills You With Visions of the Western U.S.", "text": "Sunset is a magazine dedicated to the people, culture, and lifestyle of the American west. This magazine divides its space among many different topics, such as food and entertainment, travel, recreation, gardening and more.<br /><br />I have been reading this magazine for about six months now and there are several things about it that make it worthwhile. The thing that stands out the most are the photographs, and I'm not talking about just the stunning scenery one normally associates with the West (like the National Parks or the coastline). Even the ordinary pictures are striking. In the Gardening section, for example, it is common to find pictures of family homes that have beautifully landscaped yards full of blossoming flowers and colorful plants. In the Home & Design section, one can find nice photographs of home interiors, showing different designs and furniture.<br /><br />One of the most unique qualities of Sunset is the fact that it is published in five different editions. There is a specially designed issue for the Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, and British Columbia), Northern California (Northern California and the majority of Nevada), Southern California (Southern California and Hawaii), The Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, and the Las Vegas area of Nevada), and Rocky Mountain (Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah). This is a nice idea and it's one that other magazines should consider emulating. Based on where you live or where you have an active interest, this will be the region that your issue spends its pages covering. My subscription is for the Northern California region, so I am treated each month to articles about places like San Francisco, Sacramento, Reno (Nevada), Lake Tahoe, etc.<br /><br />One of the specialties of this magazine is food and it is common to find recipes throughout every issue. There is a special section set aside for food, but one can expect to find food articles and recipes everywhere as they read. Even the cover page of each issue features a food dish. And as you might guess, the featured recipes are generally those types of cuisine normally associated with each specific region of the west, with plenty of generic recipes thrown in to make sure everyone has something to cook.<br /><br />One of the specialty sections of this magazine that I like is the \"Value Vacation\"- a subsection of Travel & Recreation. This section highlights a specific place to travel and then offers a day by day breakdown of things to do and places to see, with the cost for each itemized so you know exactly what to expect. The highlighted city or tourist area can be anyplace in the west and isn't limited to the region that your issue covers. This section is nice because it lets you see in black & white what it will cost for a few days of budget entertainment. It reminds me of some of the television programs shown on the Travel Channel.<br /><br />Advertisements cover about 40 to 50 percent of the pages of each issue and they are often found in bunches in the front and back and on alternating pages for much of the rest of each issue (typical for most magazines). The ads can center on all sorts of different things. Because this is a combination travel/culture/food/entertainment/home & garden/living magazine, the ads cover a wide range of products and services, from laundry detergent to credit cards to cat food.<br /><br />Overall, Sunset has proven itself an enjoyable magazine. I don't live in the western United States but this region is my favorite part of the country, so it makes sense that I would find something of value in this publication. I like the photography, the personal stories, the gardening and decorating ideas, and most other aspects of this magazine. If you're dead set in your ways and refuse to read about anything that deviates from your Eastern, Southern, or Midwestern lifestyle, then you may not like Sunset. But for the majority of people, Sunset has much to offer with pages and pages of eye- catching pictures and friendly articles about life in the American West.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIOW", "parent_asin": "B00005NIOW", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1137980073000, "helpful_vote": 25, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Wine Reviews, News, and More", "text": "Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products, wine facts and education, and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year, so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.<br /><br />Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine, and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings, so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80, you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis, there is often contact information, such as the name of the winery or web page, so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.<br /><br />To help shoppers find the wines in each issue, Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition, because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.<br /><br />Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like \"World's 100 Greatest Pinot\" or \"The 50 Finest California Reds\". Consumers are attracted to listings, and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like \"This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet\" or \"Greatest German White Wine Ever\". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues, but it could get annoying to some readers.<br /><br />In spite of these few annoyances, Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good, very convincing, and very persuasive. They really know wine, and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006GXD4", "parent_asin": "B00006GXD4", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1135209627000, "helpful_vote": 7, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Bridal Guide Helps Make Your Wedding Day Complete", "text": "Bridal Guide is a lengthy magazine designed to appeal to brides in waiting and to those women who see marriage on the horizon. This magazine is devoted to bridal fashion and to other things that are involved in making the day special and memorable. Besides the fashion, one can read about wedding planning, honeymoon ideas, photography, and other wedding- related things.<br /><br />When you read a copy of Bridal Guide, what stands out more than anything are the photos. This is the main reason people read this magazine in the first place: To look at wedding attire and compare different styles. Models wearing wedding gowns are abundant in this publication and some of the bridal gowns they adorn are quite stunning. To help future brides make a possible purchase, it is common to find a phone number and/or a web site with the majority of the photos. Bridal attire is the main focus of this magazine, but there are also some pictures of grooms and of other wedding party members, with models displaying other fashions for sale, once again complete with phone number and web page.<br /><br />The part of this magazine that focuses its attention on honeymoons and travel is probably my favorite part of the issue. What I like is the fact that this is one part of the magazine that can appeal/apply to anyone, regardless of marital status. These honeymoon tips and destination information provide some good reading material for the bride to be or anyone else who happens to read the magazine.<br /><br />Bridal Guide is a very lengthy publication, with each issue containing around 500 pages! This is more than double the length of most other magazines and it can make the issue seem a little overwhelming at times. Also, this magazine is saturated with ads. Since the majority of the gown- clad models are, in effect, advertisements for a specific fashion brand, one can expect to find ads covering the vast majority of this magazine's pages. This could be annoying to some, but one must bear in mind that the magazine's focus is wedding planning, so excessive advertising is expected.<br /><br />For young brides- to- be or bridal wannabes, this is a handy magazine to have around. It's very long, but it contains lots of fashion and wedding planning ideas to make the big day one to remember forever.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIRS", "parent_asin": "B00005NIRS", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1131476339000, "helpful_vote": 21, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "The Many Challenges of Business Ownership", "text": "Entrepreneur magazine is one of my favorite business publications and it's the type of magazine I can count on for up- to- date information on business startups and for possible resolutions of common problems to the small business owner. A monthly publication, this magazine is designed to appeal to those who are presently owners of a small enterprise or who aspire to open their own business in the near future.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine are its personal articles- stories about ordinary people like you and me who have successfully started a new business venture. These people share their success stories with the reader, offering insight on what strategies helped them reach their present level of success and what challenges they still face. The people featured in the articles are more down to earth types who own smaller companies, making the magazine more realistic and something I and others can better relate to. Many other business magazines spend too much time interviewing billionaire CEO's and others who, while they may have some interesting stories to share, live lifestyles and have problems that only someone of their stature can relate.<br /><br />On the practical side, Entrepreneur contains many timely articles about common issues/problems/challenges that arise when you own your own company. Money, marketing, management, and other key topics are covered in each issue, with a regular department for these critical aspects of business ownership. In these sections, you can learn about tax law changes, legal issues with benefits, and other related topics.<br /><br />Entrepreneur organizes each issue quite nicely, with colored tabs on the pages that indicate which section (money, technology, marketing, etc.) they pertain to. This makes it that much easier to sift through, to find the information you need. And there is a section titled \"Sources\" that helps to index the different services and companies mentioned in each issue.<br /><br />Overall, this is a useful, practical magazine that can come in very handy for present business owners and for those who have an interest in proprietorship. It keeps business owners up to date with the latest changes in laws and it offers some creative solutions to the everyday problems that small businesses encounter each day.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NINU", "parent_asin": "B00005NINU", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1128178646000, "helpful_vote": 10, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Living in and Learning About America's Island State", "text": "Hawaii Magazine is a very good publication for those who have an interest in America's fiftieth state. This magazine brings the world of the Hawaiian Islands to your home every month, with facts, figures, and photos taken from this island chain paradise.<br /><br />One thing about Hawaii Magazine that is different from what you might expect is that it covers more than just travel. When I read this publication for the first time, I was surprised at the contents within. I always assumed this was a magazine solely about travel and tourism. While travel, resorts, and related topics are an important part of this magazine, they are not the only part. The rest of Hawaii Magazine deals with cultural and native topics. It lets you discover the people who inhabit these islands. You get to learn about Hawaiian customs, holidays, art, dress, and culture.<br /><br />With the emphasis on culture, Hawaii Magazine is a learning experience. The people responsible for the publication of this magazine want readers to come away with a better understanding of what it means to be Hawaiian and to live in this island chain. They want you to think of Hawaii as more than just a nice, warm, sunny place to visit. They want you to learn about the people that inhabit Hawaii: How they dress, how they celebrate events, how they interact with others, etc.<br /><br />If I had to name a few cons to this magazine, they would have to be the publications short length (less than 100 pages per issue) and its infrequent publication (every two months). Other than these negative aspects, most everything else about this magazine makes it worthwhile to read. It's an educational lesson on the people and the lifestyle of those we call Hawaiian.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIO2", "parent_asin": "B00005NIO2", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1127852291000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Living and Thriving in a House Made With Logs", "text": "Log Home Living is a good magazine for those who have an active interest in buying and living in a home made from logs. This publication covers everything you need to know about this type of living, from the planning of a home all the way through the financing, the furnishing, and the maintenance.<br /><br />What I enjoy most about this magazine is the fine photographs found on most every page. I don't really have much interest in living in this type of home, but the photos are very appealing and enticing. Some of them are taken inside of log homes, letting you see firsthand the dividends that some attention to design can bring. Some of them are taken on the exterior, allowing readers to see the country landscape and marvel in the natural beauty.<br /><br />Another nice feature of this magazine is the abundance of phone numbers and web sites for goods and services. If you find something you like, you will know exactly where to turn for more information. If you find a product or service you like that doesn't list a source, don't worry- there are some special index sections in the back with lists of products from the current issue, referenced by page number, showing the company name, phone, and web site so you can find what you like and make a purchase.<br /><br />On the negative side, a magazine like this one contains LOTS of advertisements. The majority of them are found at the end of the magazine, but there are plenty of them throughout and you cannot turn more than a few pages before finding one. I would estimate that more than two- thirds of the pages have some sort of advertisement.<br /><br />Since a good deal of this magazine is dedicated to furnishing, interior design, landscaping, and maintenance, there is something here to suit every home owner's needs. Even if you don't have an interest in log homes, you can still find plenty to enjoy in Log Home Living. The pictures alone make it worth a look.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7VN", "parent_asin": "B00005N7VN", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1122578091000, "helpful_vote": 2, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Attention Female Shoppers", "text": "This magazine is a product of CondeNet publishing and it is aimed at the younger female market, roughly from ages 18 to 30. This publication is a shopper's paradise, with more advertising than most any other magazine on the market.<br /><br />I got a complimentary subscription to this magazine one day and I accepted, not only because it was free, but also because I really didn't know it was a woman's fashion magazine. With a title like \"Lucky\", there were all sorts of possibilities. It could have been about gambling, sweepstakes, or about getting lucky. I didn't know it was a woman's magazine, so I accepted it. And from what I can see, this magazine is one of average worth to the average person and it will appeal mostly to younger women.<br /><br />Fashion covers a good amount of the magazine's 200 plus pages. Beauty tips are another important area of coverage. It is also common to see samples of different products inside the pages of each issue. Things like perfume samples, shampoo, and other things can be found buried somewhere within each copy. The coverage includes casual as well as high- class clothing and beauty products, with most of it falling at the upper end of the cost scale.<br /><br />If you can tolerate the clogging of advertisements, this magazine might be a good choice for the younger female crowd that likes to keep in- tune with the latest styles and trends. Outside of that targeted market, however, I don't see much use for Lucky magazine. The photography is very good and the presentation is professional, but the magazine will likely be rated average by a large cross- section of the population.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIRG", "parent_asin": "B00005NIRG", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1106925002000, "helpful_vote": 11, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Good Eats, Fine Drinks, and Having Fun", "text": "Food and Wine is a pretty good magazine for those who enjoy the finer things in life when it comes to unusual cuisine and expensive fermented beverages. This publication is usually very long- over 250 pages- and its packed full of recipes, travel excursions to wine growing regions, and general facts about different varieties of wine and where to find them.<br /><br />One thing about this magazine that surprised me at first is the emphasis on the food. I know the magazine is titled \"Food and Wine\", but my initial impression was that this would be a magazine devoted entirely to wine with occasional mention of the foods that go with wine. It isn't like that at all. The food sections and the recipes are just as important as the featured wines. Recipes are so frequent, in fact, that the magazine even has an index located near the front with all the recipes listed by food type, showing the page number to turn to for the recipe.<br /><br />Besides the frequent talk about food and wine, this magazine is also dedicated to entertaining. I have heard it suggested that this magazine should change its name to \"Food, Wine, and Entertainment\". It would make sense, because conviviality and high- class partying are certainly an important component of this magazine.<br /><br />There is one thing about Food and Wine that I wish was different. I appreciate the factual information and I like the personal touch that you find in some of the stories about winery owners, chefs, and the like. But I think Food and Wine gets a little too sidetracked from time to time in its reporting. For example, it is common to find stories that talk about subjects like home decorating. This would be fine in a magazine about home design, but I don't think it belongs in a magazine like this.<br /><br />Overall, this is still a good publication. Lovers of great eats and fine drinks will enjoy it the most. It's worth taking a look, if nothing else, just for the recipes. Even if you're not a frequent imbiber of the fruit of the vine, there is still something of interest to be found in the pages of this magazine.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NINY", "parent_asin": "B00005NINY", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1106068868000, "helpful_vote": 50, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 4.0, "title": "Technology and Public Policy", "text": "Technology magazines are often a little bit on the boring side due to their limited appeal that makes them readable only to those who work in or have an avid interest in this field. IEEE Spectrum, however, is a little bit different. It has plenty of information on the latest advancements in technology, like other tech publications, but from a different \"spectrum\", if you will.<br /><br />What sets this magazine apart from the rest is the personal and political topics that make their way into each issue. You can read about topics like global warming, tariffs, technology regulations, and general business ethics. These different topics are blended together with the magazine's core subject of technology and the result is a publication that is more readable than most in the tech field.<br /><br />Another nice thing about Spectrum is the minimal amount of advertising. What few ads you will see are entirely related in some way to technology. You won't see an ad for a car, boat, home financing, or other product or service like you do in most every other magazine in America. This magazine sticks with technology for its ads and because of this, the few ads that exist seem even less common than they already are.<br /><br />This magazine is a little shorter than other monthly publications, with each issue containing about 50 to 80 pages. This is the length I expect in a weekly magazine- not a monthly one. The publishers need to improve and expand the number of pages. A magazine this short doesn't provide enough reading material for an entire month.<br /><br />Still, IEEE Spectrum is a good technology magazine. The combination of political, economic, and social topics keeps this publication from getting too dry and too technical. It makes it much easier to read than other magazines of the same genre.", "images": [], "asin": "B0000C4CU9", "parent_asin": "B0000C4CU9", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1103824314000, "helpful_vote": 9, "verified_purchase": false}

For these types, nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course, but Golf Digest comes very close. This magazine contains over 200 pages each month, dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf.<br /><br />The things that set Golf Digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews. Other golfing publications attempt to help you learn, but they often get too mechanical. Golf Digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals, including some of the star- studded members of the golfing elite like Tiger Woods.<br /><br />Besides all the tips and tricks, Golf Digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game. This personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine's overall appeal, providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine.<br /><br />Golfing Digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course, but it comes close. I consider it the best publication of its kind and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7QD", "parent_asin": "B00005N7QD", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1103343320000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

This publication is one of dozens available on the newsstands that cover the sport and hobby of sailing, but I feel its one of the best around.<br /><br />What makes me feel so strongly about this magazine is the fact that the articles and advice are written by actual sailors. This magazine doesn't waste the reader's time with articles composed by so- called professional writers. Instead, it sticks with the people who know sailing better than anyone: the sailors themselves. This makes the magazine more believable and more respectable.<br /><br />Sail divides its time between factual articles and ones that are more personable in nature. The factual articles cover things like how to maneuver a boat in different directions; what to look for when you shop for a new navigation device; the advantages and disadvantages of catamarans; etc. These factual stories are intended more for those who own boats and want to keep them in tip- top condition. The other articles deal with personal stories, and they rank among my favorites in each issue. These articles feature individuals and families who share their sea- going experiences with you.<br /><br />Sail also has lots of reviews of boat- related products and plenty of ads in the back of each issue for shoppers who are looking for a boat. Ads in the rest of the magazine are scattered around, but they tend to stick mostly to boating and related products. The reviews are nice, but I would prefer to see more opinions from more people, to make comparisons.<br /><br />Sail magazine has many great qualities, and they add up to a well- rounded publication- a magazine that I feel is the best in its field. Whether you sail for sport or for leisure, Sail magazine is probably the best of its kind.

When most people think about National Geographic, they usually think about the great photographs of natural wonders, exotic plants, and animal wildlife. These things are all great, but they form only part of the magazine's overall appeal. Stories about different cultures and peoples from around the world are just as good, and are usually presented in a personal way. You feel like you know the people on an intimate level when you read this magazine.<br /><br />This publication contains between 120 and 160 pages in most issues, with about a dozen or so monthly departments, as well as some varied articles that change each month, but are always concentrated on nature, science, politics, culture, etc.<br /><br />National Geographic is often very educational and intellectual, making it a learning device as well as a magazine for entertainment.

This magazine covers areas like sports, adventure travel, fashion and style, cars and trucks, career issues, etc. This publication directs all of its articles toward men, with an emphasis on what is most appealing to males throughout a typical week in their lives.<br /><br />One thing about Men's Journal that is a little different from other men's magazines is that it doesn't flaunt women to sell its issues. In fact, there are practically no pictures of women at all in this publication- something that will be considered an asset to some, and a liability to others. This magazine refuses to play the female card and instead focuses its articles on topics that men like to read about.<br /><br />Men's Journal is often obsessed with lists, and I think this is especially true in the last few years. Take a look at the cover of most issues and you will see a large, boldface advertisement for some sort of list. In one issue, it might be a ranking of the best cities for entry level jobs. In another issue, it might be a listing of the best places for young entrepreneurs. Whatever it might be, Men's Journal seems to have an infatuation with lists, probably because men like lists and it helps increase sales.<br /><br />This magazine can be counted on to produce some fairly good reading, but I must warn that many of the articles are a little too simplistic, with little emphasis on intellectualism. Even the articles about politics and business are often riddled with obvious statements that most anyone would know. But overall, I still think Men's Journal is a good magazine.

Less common are the articles involving personal finance and other topics. These financial articles are a nice addition, and I was surprised when I first saw them in this magazine. But potential readers should be forewarned that these articles are not very in- depth. They only skim the surface of finance, talking about such simple matters as balancing a checkbook, refinancing a home, and paying off credit card debt. You aren't going to find a story about purchasing stock options or selecting tech stocks. Family Circle keeps it simple and covers only those financial topics that are relevant to taking care of the home and daily living.<br />Family Circle is published 15 times per year, with a low subscription cost. It may not cover topics as thoroughly as other, more specific magazines and it can sometimes get a little repetitive from month to month.

Each issue is about 130 pages in length and can be counted on to stimulate your intellectual curiosity.<br />One thing that makes Scientific American more appealing than other science magazines is the fact that it includes articles on more than just the physical sciences, like physics, chemistry, geology, etc. It also contains timely and informative articles on social sciences, like economics and politics. This adds a lot to the magazine's appeal, and it's one of the main reasons why I choose to read it each month.<br />One thing that might bother some potential readers of this magazine is that Scientific American does tend to present a mostly pro- government angle on the social and human interest stories that it presents. In almost every instance, the writers of Scientific American draw the immediate conclusion that only the government can possibly solve the pressing issues of the day. They don't even give much consideration to anything else. They immediately concede most any problem to the authority of the state.<br />In spite of the \"liberal\" leanings, however, I feel that Scientific American is still a very good publication to read.

{"rating": 2.0, "title": "I Wish I was Thirteen Again", "text": "Stuff is a sister publication to Maxim magazine. It is similar to Maxim in several ways. Both feature a significant share of silly articles and questionable writing abilities by the journalists who contribute to each issue. And, of course, both focus on women and sex to help them sell.<br />With Stuff, the reader is treated to approximately 150 pages of mindless drivel, with goofy monthly departments like \"A Guy and His Stuff\", which features a male celebrity who describes some of his favorite possessions, and the \"Back page Activity Sheet\", which features a puzzle of some sort, like a word search or maze. As you can see from these two examples, Stuff is not exactly an intellectually stimulating magazine. It is aimed at a young male crowd- even younger than the target market of Maxim.<br />Most guys who purchase Stuff do so for the photos of near- naked women. These photos can be found throughout the magazine, from the cover and on through to the end. The interviews with some of these celebrities are about as useless as they could possibly be, with most of the conversation in the interviews geared toward personal relationships and feelings about any number of shallow topics.<br />If you like to reminisce about your days in junior high school, the Stuff might be a good choice of magazines for you. But if you prefer at least an inkling of intelligence, then I recommend passing on Stuff. There isn't much substance here at all, and most of what you read will leave you shaking your head and rolling your eyes. The magazine's primary audience is the 16 to 22 age group and even many in the target group will find it idiotic. For everyone else, Stuff is a total waste of time.

{"rating": 3.0, "title": "Maximum Female Fun for Young Men", "text": "Maxim is a monthly publication aimed at the younger male population, aged 16 to 30. This magazine offers a few amusing tidbits each month, like jokes and unusual ways to make things. There is an occasional fashion article, and some monthly articles on electronic gadgets and music. But the primary reason why people buy Maxim and the main reason it sells as well as it does is the women.<br />Maxim is not really an adult magazine, like Playboy or Penthouse. Its photographs do not expose so much that they should garner an X rating. But many of them come very close. From the picture on the cover (always a young woman, often with a seductive look in her eyes and much flesh exposed) to the photos in the middle, Maxim uses sex to sell. It isn't strictly a photo- op magazine for young women. There are interviews to accompany the visual effects. But the small talk is almost always geared toward sex- how to get it, how to keep getting it for a long time, how to improve your chances to get it, how to help friends get it, how to turn women on, etc.<br />The photos in Maxim are enticing, and I don't think any red- blooded American male would deny this fact. But what hurts Maxim a little bit and what keeps it from gaining as much respect as it could have is the monthly dose of stupidity that comes with each issue. Much of what you find in the \"How to\" section, for example, is idiotic and I cannot imagine anyone taking it seriously. The \"Bar Exam\" feature is also bordering on stupidity, with a set of trivia questions each month about some type of useless information.<br />Overall, I think Maxim is at least an average magazine, in spite of its flaws. Yes, many of the articles are brainless and the humor is the type that would amuse a 12- year old. But the main reason people buy and read (or should I say look) at Maxim is the photographs of the women. With so much flesh exposed, without going to far, Maxim is a publication with a purely visual bend. You won't find much intelligence here, but you will find plenty of photos of scantily clad women, tempting your hormones with their youthful good looks and uninhibited personalities.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIPP", "parent_asin": "B00005NIPP", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1081169558000, "helpful_vote": 12, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Flawless Publication for Lovers of the Great Outdoors", "text": "Backpacker is an outstanding magazine for those who love to hike and also for those who enjoy paging through a magazine containing lots of enticing photographs of nature scenes. This magazine is, first and foremost, a publication for lovers of the outdoors and the sport of backpacking. But the pictures of mountains, lakes, streams, wildlife, etc., are enticing to anyone. They can quickly convert the non- outdoorsman type into a nature lover.<br />Besides the great pictures, Backpacker is also excellent for its product testing and for its advice and educational material. Backpacks, mountain bikes, tents, and so forth might seem like simple products, but you would be surprised at how many different varieties and options are available for this type of merchandise. Backpacker describes different items available for sale, complete with web site address and phone# so you can make a purchase, and it often conducts tests to see how the different products stack up. It also offers educational material on the sport of backpacking and general advice on such topics as food, exercise, proper nutrition, first aid, etc.<br />Backpacker averages between 90 and 120 pages in total length and it's published 9 times per year (three of the issues combine two months into one). It's one of the few special interest magazines I have read that has something to offer most anyone. Even if you don't like hiking, there is still a good chance you will enjoy thumbing through the pages of Backpacker, if nothing else, just to enjoy the great photography.<br />Overall, this is an outstanding outdoor publication. The articles, the personal stories, the advice, the photos, and the educational material all add up to a perfect magazine for anyone who loves to partake in outdoor activity or who just enjoys looking at the stunning photos. 5+ stars to Backpacker!", "images": [], "asin": "B00005NIN8", "parent_asin": "B00005NIN8", "user_id": "AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ", "timestamp": 1067873213000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}

Each issue features stunning photography, articles from people who have visited various world islands, and advertisements on popular travel destinations around the globe.<br />The articles covered in this magazine usually focus on popular islands for travelers, like the Caribbean, South Pacific Islands, Hawaii, etc. But on occassion, the magazine features other islands, too, including those that are not as popular as tourist destinations like the Balearic Islands, Ceylon, Madagascar, and others.<br />There are LOTS of advertisements in this magazine, and that might not sit well with some readers who prefer more articles and less selling. But the ads are helpful to the reader because they often include bargain prices. There are also classified ads from other readers who have island vacation property to rent.<br />If you like to travel and you love water, then Islands magazine is a great publication to read.

Our 19 year old son found her pawing around in his hidden stash of NATURE FRIEND MAGAZINES which we had stopped getting over a decade ago.  He kept carrying on about how he wished we could get it again \"for her sake\".<br />I looked all over the internet, through every directory and in old editions of the magazine, but NATURE FRIEND seemed to have disappeared.<br />Then we found it here on AMAZON.COM a couple of months ago.  We got our first issue a few weeks ago and there is always someone reading it somewhere in the house- ME INCLUDED!<br />The quality of the magazine is greatly improved.  There is plenty to do for all ages, recipes, studies of interesting things (like where do dandelions come from and how did they get here and what do you do with them....) and interactive projects for all ages.<br />One of our favorite features is the HOW TO DRAW series that they still have.  Very nice lessons on drawing some kind of animal or natural thing are given.  Readers send in their best shot at it and many photos of their contributions are featured in future issues.  There is a lot packed in to this 25 page magazine- and NO ADS!<br />I can not rate this magazine highly enough.

So the recipe had 8.4g of fat but 35.1g of carbs . I think if they are going to say a recipe is healthier they should also reduce the sugar. So next time I'll remember how sweet the cake was and lower the amount of sugar to say 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. Light to me at least seems to mean less fat AND sugar. I didn't play around with the recipe because I only had three bananas and couldn't afford to get it wrong on the first try.

For example, the April/May 2004 issue had articles on:<br /><br />Home Cooking - a contractor and his three sons design a home with the kitchen at the heart of the home.<br /><br />Cutting It Up - A downtown Los Angeles loft gets a makeover.<br /><br />Stainless Chef - Designer John Picard finds a sanctuary with a high-tech steam oven and a hand-carved tub.<br /><br />Victorian Revival - A San Franscico couple is the inspiration for a dramatic culinary renovations.<br /><br />Trend Diva - Jane Szita talks about nesting and nihilism.<br /><br />Other interesting articles include information on houses that become art, short reviews for books on subjects such as living in a small space.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the house designed with mostly windows on page 45 and high tech enthusiasts will also love features for speakers or CD changers which are most modern.<br /><br />Well, until I can afford a 9,500 buck oven, I'll keep reading and dreaming. The library in the April/May issue is to die for! Big windows and shelves galore.<br /><br />Dwell is a magazine designed to inspire and inspire it did! Even some of the text is in color. The Marketplace section gives you a wealth of sources to encourage you to start on your own dream design, house or otherwise.

When looking through this magazine you need a good cup of tea and a pair of scissors. You will be cutting out a lot of recipes! In fact, I'm sitting here cutting out recipes in between typing. There are 16 pages of recipes in a \"card\" format.<br /><br />The Favorite Meal section and Cooking for One or Two is always of interest. It shows you how to put an entire meal together and all the recipes are included.<br /><br />There is also a section where you can view enviable country kitchens. Then you can learn how to make ordinary foods extraordinary. Add curry powder to chicken salad or add brewed coffee to cookie dough.<br /><br />The \"Men Who Run the Range\" section is a series featuring men who love to cook and then you can also find out what people are eating in various states across the country. These are ideas and recipes from real cooks across America.<br /><br />One time I looked in the \"Does Anyone Have...?\" section and found a note about a woman who was looking for specific items. After sending her a small box, she then reciprocated and sent me the most beautiful framed pressed flowers. It is a fun section where you can read about recipes people are looking for and if you have the recipe, there is an address where you can mail the item. I recently learned how to make rosemary crackers and someone is looking for a recipe for various crackers.<br /><br />This magazine also has info on cooking schools all over the country. You could also be a Field Editor and share your recipes, cooking tips and other ideas with the home-office staff. You could literally end up in this magazine!<br /><br />Some of the delicious recipes I've been clipping from this magazine include:<br /><br />Grilled Sirloin Steak<br />Crispy Fried Chicken<br />Herbed Seafood Skewers<br />Chicken with Rosemary<br />Vegetable Cheese Tortellini<br />Grilled Turkey Burgers<br />Beehive Cake<br />Honey Citrus Iced Tea<br /><br />Tonight I made a chicken dish with homemade stuffing and a mushroom gravy that my husband really loved. I think this magazine inspires me to cook more and I have never read this magazine without tearing out pages galore.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Dreamy Articles about Spas and Cooking", "text": "Well, in the November issue last year, this magazine had a spa getaway section. Now I know why so many people were in La Conner the last time I was there. There is a top-secret spa hiding there. Who knew! I love La Conner and had no idea there was a day spa there.<br /><br />They also featured the \"Salish Lodge and Spa\" at which you might find me drinking tea with my parents on a lazy afternoon or having dinner when I'm feeling like splurging on a gourmet dinner. They have redecorated, however they still have a wonderful fireplace upstairs. I spent the first night of my honeymoon at the Salish Lodge and I can't wait to stay there again. They have deep baths and the entire experience of staying there is just luxurious. Anyway, this magazine tells you where to go and gives you ideas for luxurious getaways now and then. Oh and don't forget Rosario. When my aunt took us away for the weekend, we had our toes painted while sitting out in the sun.<br /><br />If you are thinking of visiting Seattle, this is a good magazine to keep handy so you can find out about treasures like the Elliot Bay Book Company or Pike Place Market. The Dining Guide will lad you to places you only thought appeared in dreams. If you are in Seattle, go to Palisade. There is an amazing view, gourmet food to die for and even a fish pond with a cute bridge you can walk over. We love this place for family parties. Ray's boathouse has an upstairs caf\u00e9 we love and then there is the Metropolitan Grill where you will taste steaks that have been grilled over mesquite coals. If you want to go all out and enjoy a nine-course feast, try The HerbFarm that is now located in Woodinville. Chef Jerry Traunfeld also makes amazing Lavender cookies and the recipe is in his HerbFarm cookbook.<br /><br />This magazine inspires thoughts of staying at the Edgewater hotel and watching ferries sail by on lazy rainy days. You will always find intriguing features, talk about the town and a section on enjoying the good life of food and entertainment.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review", "images": [], "asin": "B00006KWIC", "parent_asin": "B00006KWIC", "user_id": "AGWDYYVVWM3DC3CASUZKXK67G6IA", "timestamp": 1075362334000, "helpful_vote": 8, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "much needed history resource for kids", "text": "Cobblestone Magazine is advertised for grades four through nine.  It's all about American history.  Because there are so many controversial and delicate topics covered, I would encourage parents to think carefully about whether a younger child is prepared to read and discuss Cobblestone articles.  Gifted readers under eight who may be fine with the vocabulary and serious tone of the articles may be too sensitive to be exposed to the often dark content.  Recent sample issues covered D-day and the Allied invasion of Normandy, Ken Burns and his documentary on World War II, and John F. Kennedy.<br /><br />The D-Day issue includes a photo of a fallen soldier and the remark, \"Omaha Beach was littered with smashed vehicles and dead and dying men.\"  This issue also has a great map of the invasion plan, military statistics, and profiles of key players in the war.  Churchill, F.D.R., Stalin, Eisenhower, and Hitler are among those covered.  There are also stories on code breaking,  engineering marvels, spies, and clever deceptions.  An interview with Buck Compton, real life hero portrayed in Spielberg and Hanks' \"Band of Brothers\" film, is another highlight.<br /><br />The issue on Ken Burns mentions the Bataan Death March and civilian families held for years in a  Manila prison camp.  Ken Burns has done a fabulous job of documenting so much important American History.  I am excited to see an entire issue devoted to his work.  His passion for history really helps to bring it alive and allows kids to understand that it's much more than a bunch of dates to memorize.<br /><br />The issue devoted to John F. Kennedy is balanced and fair. There is a story about his childhood, another about his experience with PT 109, and then a look at his campaign and the first televised Presidential debate.  A presidential time line details his time in office and there are articles on the cold war, Cuban missile crisis, and his assassination.  An interview with Caroline Kennedy informs readers about the JFK Library and the Profiles in Courage award.<br /><br />These issues are jammed with factual accounts, interviews, and terrific photos, as well as theme related crossword puzzles, cartoons, and \"brain ticklers\" which are actually short quizzes based on the content of the current issue.  Contests encourage readers to submit their own versions of World War II posters,<br />or to nominate a local good citizen.  Real kids offer reviews of theme related web sites and books.  There are also suggestions on places to visit, such as the National World War II Museum in New Orleans and in Washington D.C.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Cobblestone both to schools and individual families wishing to encourage  children to appreciate and respect American history.

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A winner!", "text": "Odyssey Magazine-Adventures in Science is a great magazine for kids who are interested in science as well as those who might be with just a little nudge.  Target audience range is for grades 4-9.  As usual with Carus publications, there is no advertising other than information on how to purchase subscriptions to other Carus mags.<br /><br />Odyssey boasts of an impressive list of scholars on it's advisory panel.  Professors from Case Western, Harvard, Williams, and other well known institutions serve on the board.<br /><br />A recent issue all about milk was well balanced and presented very divergent viewpoints.  Regular feature, \"Science Scoops\" detailed a study that showed breast fed infants may not have an automatic advantage in IQ over their bottle fed counterparts.  The latest study points out that better educated and more intelligent mothers tend to nurse their babies, and that this may account for slightly higher than average test scores.  \"The (Almost) Perfect Food\" cites many benefits of milk and dairy in the human diet, but also mentions milk allergy and lactose intolerance.  PETA's point of view is discussed as well.  The activists in People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals regard confinement of dairy cows to be cruel.  A 12 year old girl contributes a nice piece on robotic milking machines, and we also have the opportunity to learn about the chemical compositionof milk, mammal milk substitutes, and cheese making.  A highly allergic 5th grader also shares his story on living with a milk allergy.<br /><br />Another sample issue deals with Edward O. Wilson, a brilliant entomologist known as \"the ant man\".  Wilson,  a Harvard professor and  prolific writer, is a believer in the importance of biodiversity.  His passion for his work comes through clearly in the pages of Odyssey.  Articles in this issue include, \"E.O. Wilson, Boy Naturalist\", Edward O. Wilson, Friend and Ant Man\", \"Ants Rule!\", \"See the World in a Tree Trunk\", and more.<br /><br />Regular departments appearing in each Odyssey are Activities to Discover, Science Scoops, Ask a Scientist, Brain Strain, Kids Can..., Ask Dr. Cy Borg, Star Chart, Star Gazing with Jack Horkheimer, You've Got Mail, Kids' Picks, and Animal Angles.<br /><br />My kids enjoy Odyssey and I am pleased to recommend yet another top notch magazine from Carus.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006KR0U", "parent_asin": "B00006KR0U", "user_id": "AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q", "timestamp": 1199539564000, "helpful_vote": 28, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Ask is amazing!", "text": "Ask Magazine is another wonderful publication from the originators of Cricket.  Ask is all about arts and sciences, with each issue having one unifying theme.  The recommended age range is from seven to ten, but younger fluent readers can also enjoy Ask.<br /><br />Ask contains regular features as well as a variety of articles related to the central theme.  \"Scoops\" is a two page spread of science news and discoveries.  One story might be on a robotic arm, another on the acquisition of  language in sac-winged bats.  \"Nestor's Dock\" is a double page cartoon with enjoyable recurring characters.  Each issue also has a contest which ties in with the theme.  The water issue asks readers to design a fountain, the learning issue requests that readers design a school, and an art issue invites readers to copy their favorite work of art.  Winners have their entries printed in a future issue. \"Jimmy and the Bug\" is another regular feature.  Here, readers questions are answered in cartoon format.  Questions might appear simple, \"Why do lions have manes?\" or more complex, \" what are the rings around planets made of?\"  Answers are both thoughtful and informative.  Every issue ends with the silly but sweet cartoon,  \"Marvin and Friends\", on the back cover.<br /><br />The \"Making Art\" issue of Ask includes a lovely piece on quilting traditions in rural Alabama.  Many beautiful photos of quilts are displayed alongside comments from their creators.  In the same edition, \"Playing with Mud\" showcases delicate Korean celadon pottery.<br /><br />\"The Liquid of Life\" issue of Ask has a fascinating story on water.  It covers the water cycle, water forms, a water molecule diagram, and gorgeous photographs of a water droplet, snowflake, and children and animals in various poses with rain and snow.  Information offered can be quite complex, but it is just the thing for feeding hungry young intellects.  This issue also has water trivia cards, with intriguing questions such as, what can go longer without water, a camel, or a giraffe? An article on water powered generators is very well done, and the issue is rounded out with a nice tour of bogs, fens, swamps, and marshes.<br /><br />I'm very pleased to recommend Ask.  It's funny but not obnoxious, informative but not controversial,  with articles a bit shorter and lighter than those found in big brother's Muse Magazine.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006FXOV", "parent_asin": "B00006FXOV", "user_id": "AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q", "timestamp": 1193290131000, "helpful_vote": 159, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "A delightful magazine", "text": "Spider Magazine is a dream come true for the young gifted reader. The magazine is pitched for children ages six to nine. Strong independent readers may be ready for it earlier. Sample issues run to 33 pages, plus each has an additional  pullout paper craft. There is a lot of writing packed into this little mag and the very  youngest subscribers might prefer to have Mom, Dad, or big sister share the joy.<br /><br />Issues of Spider have a fairly predictable pattern. This is a positive for most of the target audience, who are young enough to find comfort in predictability. The publishing information is tucked into a tiny box on the inside front cover. A lovely drawing of Spider's Mailbox takes up the rest of the page, as well as all of the first page. This is the backdrop against which Spider and her little buggy friends cavort in unique poses each month. My daughter could tell you exactly who the bugs are and all about their personalities, but I'm not quite as Spider savy as she. Suffice it to say that she follows the antics of these little characters with glee, as they appear on page bottoms throughout each issue. The bugs are well loved by readers and they all receive fanmail.<br /><br />The Danderfield Twins is a recurring feature and the first story in each Spider magazine. The twins and their friends are a lively and intelligent bunch, who often must work together to solve a problem. These stories are short and sweet, running about six pages long with large type and plenty of illustrations. Other stories, puzzles, and poems may follow a particular theme. One issue appeared to have two themes, both trains and dogs. A recipe for peanutbutter dog biscuits was a pleasant surprise here.<br /><br />Illustrations in the magazine are bright and appealing. I heartily appreciate the fact that there is no advertising whatsoever included in Spider. This is very refreshing and a significant demonstration of Carus Publishing's commitment to fair marketing.<br /><br />Near the back of each issue is a department known as Spider's Corner. Reader artwork and poetry is shared here, with an invitation to submit a drawing or poem on a given idea. One request is for farm animal pictures, another for poems about pets.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006FXOT", "parent_asin": "B00006FXOT", "user_id": "AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q", "timestamp": 1181670456000, "helpful_vote": 164, "verified_purchase": false}
{"rating": 5.0, "title": "My son reads it cover to cover!", "text": "Muse is an exceptional magazine.  Though it is aimed at \"tweens\", gifted readers from about age 7 up can appreciate it.  Parents may wish to pre-read or discuss controversial pieces with their children. There are plenty of interesting articles on a variety of topics. Recent issues have covered stone disks in the Yap islands, gamers making real money from selling virtual goods,  racial prejudice, genetics, and snowflakes.<br /><br /> Muse magazine does not contain any advertising, other than subscription offers from the publisher.  It's quite refreshing.  Some of my family's other magazines (Sports Illustrated Kids, for example) are filled with ads for junk food and toys.<br /><br />A full page in Muse is always devoted to  Larry Gonick's \"Kokopelli & Company\", a cartoon featuring the magazine's quirky cartoon mascots.  These tiny creatures also cavort on pages throughout the magazine.  Bo's Page is another regular feature.  Here, readers may learn about a scientific experiment to discover how ants find their way home, or why gorillas eat wood, and  vote as to whether  humans will survive to the year 2100.  The Q & A section has answers to queries submitted by readers.  Examples questions are \"would time travel actually be possible?\" and \"what happens when you blow a (soap) bubble in winter?\" .  Robert Coontz and Rosanne Spector provide clear, and often humorous, answers.  Ivars Peterson is the Muse math guru.  His \"Math Page\"  offers suduko challenges and other math puzzles as well as articles such as \"The Simpsons and Math\".  Every issue of Muse offers a contest of some sort, tucked into the corner of a two page spread honoring winners of the previous issue's contest.  Kids are invited to become living art in a tableau vivant, or to design imaginary money.<br /><br />I highly recommend Muse for both boys and girls.", "images": [], "asin": "B00006FXOP", "parent_asin": "B00006FXOP", "user_id": "AHFAVTVOL2KUU4PRARH7ZJQOR75Q", "timestamp": 1129553102000, "helpful_vote": 279, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 5.0, "title": "Five Stars from a Landscape Designer", "text": "I do landscape design and landscape maintenance professionally, and this is the only magazine I'd recommend to clients. As another reviewer noted, The American Gardener is also a fine publication if you are very serious about plants, but for most readers, Fine Gardening best walks the line between accessability and having great information.<br /><br />I have been a subscriber for eight years and have kept every issue. The information on the spine is clear and so you can easily find that elusive article you remembered and wanted to refer to, without pulling out every issue and having to look at the cover.<br /><br />As a professional, I find the in-depth articles on different kinds of plants really helpful. It is neat to focus on say, all the different kinds of Forsythias around, so you can really compare the varieties available and know all of your options if you would like to plant one. They usually have six or more photos of the different varieties, with each photo highlighting an important aspect of the plant's habit, foliage, or bloom, plus a few photos of the plants used in a garden, so you can see what kinds of textures and colors the plant works with.<br /><br />The articles on landscape design are by well-respected professionals and offer a wonderful balance of intellectually interesting discussion and gorgeous photos. They don't always tell us exactly which plant is which in each photo, so that would be a drawback to the new gardener who isn't familiar with a number of plants, but they usually only neglect to name the plants when the photo is trying to illustrate a design concept. I think they find a good balance between urban gardening/ gardening in small spaces, and gardening in a more country or spacious setting.<br /><br />They also have articles on seasonal care (and as a reader for eight years, I haven't found any articles that are overlap or repeats), articles on broader topics like groundovers for shade or grasses in the garden (in which they usually include a large and useful list of plants, organized by foliage and flower color, size, sun needs, zone, etc), and profiles on the latest tools, books and other gardening needs.<br /><br />I have read a lot of gardening magazines over the years and Fine Gardening is by far the best. The language is simple yet the ideas are not dumbed down. Most other magazines have huge amounts of distracting advertisements, and Fine Gardening's are related to gardening, useful, and not too prolific.<br /><br />Recommended.", "images": [], "asin": "B000063XJI", "parent_asin": "B000063XJI", "user_id": "AFPF2CONJ33FNFKOEQ2TUNWQJTFQ", "timestamp": 1139111394000, "helpful_vote": 47, "verified_purchase": false}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "A decent fitness magazine IF you can overlook the flaws", "text": "About two years ago, I became a subscriber to Shape, mainly because I had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine.  I had always liked browsing through issues of Shape in the supermarket, and I thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals.  Overall, I have enjoyed Shape and found it to be useful, but there definitely are some negatives, and the magazine might not be for everyone.<br /><br />But first the good.  Like many others have mentioned, what I most enjoy about Shape is their real-life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women, some of whom actually needed to *gain* weight in order to be healthy.  I also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year-long weight loss journey.  Many of their other regular features are also excellent, particularly the body part-focused strength exercises and other how-to exercise guides.  And I especially like that Shape uses \"Reader Models\" with so many of their articles--real life women of various ages (although admittedly, mostly in the 25-35 range) with normal, healthy, strong bodies.  Finally, their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises, and the recipes are often quite good as well.<br /><br />The main negative has already been brought up by many others here:  the use of too-skinny, not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine.  I find this extremely disappointing; I understand that to sell magazines, the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness, but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong--show us some muscles now and then!  As I said above, the reader models are great; the women are usually quite fit, but they have muscles and curves too, which is wonderful to see.  Shape MAY be trying to make some improvements in this area, as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise (such as Denise Richards), but they still have a long way to go.  And while they're at it, I hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear, not bathing suits!  They can still show off their model's physique AND showcase cute fitness wear at the same time.  Similarly, I would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end *unless* they start focusing it on exercise clothing, not haute couture.<br /><br />If you are overweight and/or new to exercising, you may find the magazine discouraging, but if you can get past some of the negatives, it can also be inspiring.  I think it's up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts; for me, it is helpful, but this definitely might not be the case with everyone.", "images": [], "asin": "B00005N7SN", "parent_asin": "B00005N7SN", "user_id": "AFIJLAW3HIOMRUFSWNH54IJ3XQAA", "timestamp": 1158598246000, "helpful_vote": 14, "verified_purchase": false}

The paper is thinner and so are most of the issues, the editorials are less inviting and overwhelmed by the ads which can be printed on paper so thick it makes it hard to leaf through the magazine. And don't get me started on the vile mix of too many competing perfume samples! I don't like many scents and a number of them make me nauseous, so I pull the things out immediately and put them in the farthest-away-from-me recycling bin. Even so, the scents still linger in the paper, especially on the facing pages, so I have to wash my hands after touching the magazine--something that cuts deeply into my enjoyment of Vogue and other mags with perfume sample ads. What's still great are the personal experience essays. Vogue has always had the best writers and the most interesting takes. Some of the fashion pages are still gorgeous, though many seem like recycled versions with poses we've already seen other models do better, or photos where the clothes can't be seen in the landscape or lighting used. With the poses, I don't know if the fault is the model's, because she has a limited range of poses, expressions or emotions, or if the fault is the editor's for choosing clothes or photos that look alike, but there's a lot too much sameness to the magazine recently. I look back longingly at Grace Coddington's amazing 1920s shoot, or the Versailles spread with those incredible clothes and stunning model with her gift for inventive poses that still let us see what she's wearing, or the Alice in Wonderland shoot--all examples of the best fashion photography available--and I hope Vogue gets a renewed jolt of the creativity, craftsmanship and professional pride that has made it an exemplar.", "images": [], "asin": "B001U5SPK6", "parent_asin": "B001U5SPK6", "user_id": "AEAWAXEYKUGM5BW6B5OCEMXZQE2Q", "timestamp": 1482762806000, "helpful_vote": 78, "verified_purchase": true}

{"rating": 4.0, "title": "informative, interesting, good layperson level", "text": "NewScientist is a lot of fun to read and keeps you up to date with some of the newest science being done. It's a nice laypersons' coverage. It doesn't approach Scientific American in its depth, complexity, or \"sciency\" language, but it's popularized rather than dumbed down. The writing is always clear and concise.  I'd say it probably is not as simplified or \"newsy\" as Discover (which I also read and enjoy), putting it in a nice middle category of science for laypeople magazines.  It comes weekly, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />It has a \"this week\" section which covers a few topics in short fashion (1/2 to 1 page articles), then an \"In Brief\" section which covers more topics, um, in brief (usually 1/4 page articles).  There are a few pages of brief Technology articles (1/3rd to 1 page articles), a science-based editorial, an interview or two, and then several longer, in-depth articles, including the cover article. These are usually 3 or 4 pages with the cover article 4-6 pages.  Recent cover topics  have been the Higgs, Memory, Neutrinos.  The magazine closes with some book reviews, a feedback section, and a question-to-the editors section.  I write and I find myself often clipping out articles of interest or of use.  Even better, a subscription gives you their entire on-line archive, as well as regular email updates.
