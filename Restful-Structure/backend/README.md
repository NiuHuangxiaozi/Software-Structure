# WebPOS

The demo shows a simple POS system in MVC architecture, which replaces the shell interface in aw02 with a pos web ui (https://github.com/bshbsh404/simple-pos-ui
).

To run

```shell
mvn clean spring-boot:run
```

Currently, it just lists the products for sale with a cart with one item (just for demonstration).

Based on the code provided, please complete this assignment:

- Read the tutorial at  https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-crud-thymeleaf or https://www.baeldung.com/tag/thymeleaf/ and make the POS system robust and functional.
- Save data to some database, such as mysql or h2, just like the [petclinic project](https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic).
- And elaborate your understanding in MVC architecture via this homework in your README.md.
